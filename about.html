<h2>Contact</h2>
<p>Email: <a class="reference external" href="mailto:graham@percival-music.ca">graham@percival-music.ca</a></p>
<p>Of course, thanks to various heroic whistleblowers, we know that
all emails are being stored and read at will by various
intelligence services.  Fortunately or not, so far I've never
dealt with anything sensitive.  For that reason, when my latest
GPG key expired, I didn't bother setting up a new one.</p>
<p>In the past, I set up a non-expiring key and forgot the
passphrase; you can see the details on my blog post <a class="reference external" href="blog/2009-08-09-me-idiot.html">I'm an idiot:
forgotten GPG passphrase</a>.</p>
<p>If you need to communicate with me privately, I'm quite willing to
set up a new GPG key.</p>

<h2>Music and Dance</h2>
<div class="section" id="music">
<h3>Music</h3>
<p>I began playing cello when I was four years old, and joined my
first orchestra when I was nine.  I began composing in Aug 2001,
started playing viola in 2002, and started playing violin in 2004.</p>
<p>I've played cello, viola, second violin, and first violin with the
<a class="reference external" href="http://westcoastsymphony.ca/">West Coast Symphony Orchestra</a>,
(the best non-professional orchestra in Vancouver, Canada).  I
teach cello and violin as a hobby.</p>
<p>My primary instrument is the cello; I played the Dvorak cello
concerto with two orchestras (although I should clarify that this
occurred during rehearsals as a "warm-up act" or "practice
stand-in" for the real soloist).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dance">
<h3>Dance</h3>
<p>I began social partner dancing (ballroom and swing) in 2016.  I
was originally planning on trying half a dozen new hobbies, but I
was so enthralled by dancing that I never got around to trying the
others.  I love the non-verbal communication in social dancing --
we don't use any choreographed steps; instead, the "leader"
improvises the movements on the spot and the "follower" acts on
the given directions.  I happily dance both parts.</p>
