<p>For the past four years, I sent emails to my family with the subject
line "Living with the Bunnies, issue X". This was a reference to the
UVic campus; the University of Victoria is inhabited by a large number
of rabbits.</p>
<p>These emails contained news about my studies, first getting a B.Mus in
Music, and later getting a M.A. (interdisciplinary) in Computer Science
and Music. They also contained complaints about my supervisors [1],
stories about my students [2], rants about UVic administrative practices
(26 pages of ethics approval to run an anonymous web survey!) [3], and
all the things that are normal and healthy for a graduate student to be
telling their friends on the weekends. I resisted calls to put these on
the web in the form of a blog, since some of those stories weren't
suitable for public viewing.</p>
<p>[1] I actually didn't have too many complaints about my academic
supervisors. "Teaching supervisors" (i.e. instructors that I was TAing
for) are another story, though.</p>
<p>[2] Again, I can't think of specific negative stories about my students.
But I definitely wanted to be able to mock them privately in the Bunny
emails if they <em>had</em> done anything particularly stupid. I also discussed
a few assignments in more detail than I'd want to be telling a student,
particularly for CSC 110 in the summer of 2008.</p>
<p>[3] Oh, I have <em>plenty</em> of complaints about the ethics review process.
:)</p>
<p>Now that I've graduated, I don't expect to have the same amount of
stories that shouldn't be made public. Hence the public blog.</p>

<p>The name may change next year once I've started a PhD -- it'll depend on
what the mascots (both official and unofficial) of the university / city
/ country are, and how appealing they are to me. I like cute fuzzy
animals, so "Bunnies" struck a chord with me.</p>
<p>(yes, the initial blog entries are pre-dated)</p>
