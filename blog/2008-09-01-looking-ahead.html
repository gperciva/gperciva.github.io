<p>Everybody asks me "what are you doing next?". Here's my plans:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Next few days: do nothing.</li>
<li>Sep 08 - Dec 08: don't get a day job. Take contract work (either
programming or, much more likely, music) if it makes itself
available.</li>
<li>Jan 09 - June 09: research assistant at the National University of
Singapore.</li>
<li>July 09 - Aug 09: no plans, but still no day job. Contract work or
prep for PhD.</li>
<li>Sep 09 onwards: PhD candidate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Location for the PhD? I'm trying to arrange it at a university in
Scotland. Not for the country; there's a specific person I want to do
the PhD with. Funding is a big issue, though -- tuition would be 12,350
pounds per year, and the cost of living in the UK is pretty high. I'm
quite optimistic, though; there's a year to work things out, and the
professor was quite keen to get me there.</p>
<p>If that doesn't work out, then I'd remain in Canada. Two of the Canadian
universities I was thinking about attending have close ties to the
Scottish university, so if I went to them, it would be very easy to be a
foreign exchange student (paying domestic student rates) for a year.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>Open-source work: I have about 5 hours of work left to do for LilyPond
and Marsyas. Then I'm going to do about 20-30 hours on Strasheela. And
I'll be making MEAWS (my thesis project; Musician Evaluation and
AWdition for Strings) publicly available after fixing a few major
embarassments.</p>
<p>At that point I'll be looking for new projects in need of limited-time
help. NUS has a very strict copyright policy, so I'm not going to be
working on any open-source projects while I'm there. So I have Oct - Dec
free to spend on such projects. I'll take a serious look at FreeBSD,
since my brother is so involved in it. Other than that... who knows?</p>

</div>
<p>For fun: I have a year's worth of fantasy books to get from the library
-- I haven't had access to a public library for the past year, so I'm
sure that all my favorite authors have published new books.</p>
<p>I also have 6 anime boxed sets to watch, with 4 more coming in the mail.
I usually buy them online and have them shipped to my parent's house
(since that's the address on my credit card). I occasionally take one
back to Victoria when I visit my parents, but I generally just let them
pile up while I was finishing the Masters.</p>
<p>I also need to clean up my room (it's the family storage room, so a lot
of junk has piled up in the past two years), start a string quartet,
join an orchestra or two, start seriously practicing violin... I'll have
plenty of things to keep me occupied.</p>
