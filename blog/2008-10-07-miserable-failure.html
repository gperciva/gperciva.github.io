<p>I attempted to do 21.2km (slightly more than a half marathon). I failed.</p>
<p>At 1 hour and 47 minutes -- that's almost an hour longer than I've ever
ran before -- my muscles stopped. I'd been getting gradually slower for
the past half hour; at the time I wasn't really going faster than a fast
walk. I wasn't panting at all, nor was my heart rate fast. My muscles
just stopped responding.</p>
<p>Actually, I had some difficulty earlier -- shortly after beginning my
second lap, my right knee started to hurt. I considered turning back,
but I stupidly decided to keep on going. Don't do this at home, boys and
girls. When you're panting and you generally hurt, sure, keep on
running. When you feel pain in your chest... well, you should probably
stop running, but I keep on going. When you start to lose circulation to
your fingers... again, that's probably a really bad sign and you should
slow down or stop, but I keep on going.</p>
<p>However, when your joints start to hurt, stop. I mean, even <em>I</em> will
stop (in the future) when that happens. And we've already established
that I take a lot of stupid risks while running.</p>
<p>Anyway, when my right knee was hurting, I limped along by putting more
weight on my left leg. After about 2km, my right knee felt ok (or just
stopped complaining), so I started running normally for a while. But
then I noticed that I was slowing down, and couldn't speed up again. I
wasn't out of breath, and I wasn't in pain... I just couldn't get my
muscles to move faster. After a while of that, I tripped slightly and
started walking, and couldn't start running again. I couldn't even walk
normally... it took me half an hour to reach the car, and a pair of
elderly ladies passed me. I was going <em>really</em> slowly.</p>
<p>Anyway, it was an interesting experience. I think I definitely qualify
as "injured" -- I couldn't get into bed without lifting my right leg
with my hands -- and it certainly qualifies as "self-inflicted" and
"caused by stupidity". But at the same time, the only way to learn about
this kind of thing is to experience it once or twice. I would have never
paid attention if anybody warned me about this before today... actually,
come to think of it, I think a few of my friends <em>did</em> warn me.</p>
<p>And I certainly chose the right time to do it -- I'm living with my
parents, with no immediate deadlines. I have a few days until I play in
orchestra or do any music teaching, so my daily life is relatively
untroubled by this injury. It'd be terrible if this happened at UVic --
I wouldn't be able to bike or walk to university. Now, I'm sure that my
landlord would have given me a car ride... but still, I'd rather not be
wandering around the university using the hand rails to pull myself up
stairs.</p>
<p>Yes, definitely a valuable experience. And hey, how often do you get to
say "yeah, I failed... I only ran for 17km without stopping"? :)</p>
<p>PS: running a marathon is definitely a "when", not an "if".</p>
