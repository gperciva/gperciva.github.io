<p>All the cool kids are doing reviews of the past year, so I figured that
I should do some kind of a review too. Of course, lots of un-cool people
are also doing reviews, but we all know that I'm one of the cool ones.</p>
<p>At the beginning of Nov, I started accompanying a musical on the cello.
I wouldn't normally play a musical -- there's too many performances, so
I'm generally bored with the music by opening night, let alone by the
end! -- but it had been two years since I'd done any semi-serious music,
so I thought it would be a good exercise. I'm happy to report that I've
still "got it going on". Yes, the first two weeks hurt a bit -- playing
the cello takes a lot more muscle than violin -- but I was still able to
keep track of everybody in the ensemble, and could often pinpoint
mistakes before the music director could.</p>
<p>I wanted to get all my old compositions in a publishable state, but that
didn't happen. This wasn't entirely my fault -- I was waiting for
<a class="reference external" href="http://lilypond.org">lilypond 2.12</a> to be released -- but I could
have done more prep work so that it would have been faster to finalize
them. Oh well; at least that will give me something relaxing to work on
in Singapore.</p>
<p>In other news, I've been accepted to the University of Glasgow for the
PhD. I still need to work out the funding; the tuition is over 12,000
pounds per year. But apparently in the UK one has to get accepted by the
university before one applies for scholarships, so this means I'm one
step closer.</p>
<p>I'm not really certain what to do about MEWER now. I'm hesitant to start
advertizing it, because if there's any problems I can't fix them while
I'm in Singapore. On the other hand, it's probably good enough to help
some people, so it'd be a shame not to mention it to them.</p>
<p>Finally, I'm becoming the next release manager of lilypond, and starting
up a <a class="reference external" href="http://percival-music.ca/gop/">Grand Organization Project</a> for
lilypond. The Grand Documentation Project was a great success, so I'm
hoping to do the same thing on a larger scale.</p>
