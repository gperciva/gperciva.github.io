<p>T minus 36 hours or so.</p>
<p>Suitcases are packed, other than this laptop + power cord + hair brush.
Printed out invitations letters, copied map to apartment, etc. Finally
finished moving all files over to my new laptop.</p>
<p>One friend had a really great idea: wear a shirt for customs. I'm taking
this a step further and wearing my best clothes (well, best apart from
full orchestra dress). Shirt, dress pants, braid, make-up... ok, not the
last one. I won't be as comfortable when traveling, but anything that
makes government officials easier to deal with is worth it.</p>
<p>I'm also making a few resolutions. New Year's resolutions are a big
thing in North America, but I've never bothered with them. And I'm still
not -- these are strictly aimed at Singapore, not life in general.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Work from 9 to 5, unless it's obvious that the research group behaves
otherwise. Yes, it's totally unnatural to wake up at the same time
every day, but I'm going to try to do it for the five months.</li>
<li>Do one touristy thing every week (probably on Sunday). I've glanced
at a few tourist guides, and the only thing that remotely caught my
eye was the crocodilarium (a zoo, just for crocodiles, with over a
thousand beasts). But I'll force myself to stop working and go visit
something. And with my superior cheapness, I'll do my best to enjoy
whatever I pay money to see.</li>
<li>Impose a strict "1 week and you're out" email policy. I have the
evening for catching up on emails, so this <em>shouldn't</em> be difficult,
but I'll find some time (maybe Sunday evening?) to do my final
replies and then delete whatever's left.</li>
<li>Never refuse to try any vegetarian non-alcoholic dish. I don't have
my PhD so I still won't touch alcohol, and I'm extremely cautious
about stuff that came from animals (seafood included). Fortunately,
Singapore seems to really push multiculturalism and there's a good
fraction of Buddhists, so I can probably ask for vegetarian food
without offending anybody.</li>
