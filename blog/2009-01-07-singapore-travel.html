<p>Ok, I'm here now.</p>
<p>The first flight was very nice. It was a Boeing 777-300, and it had LCD
displays on the back of every seat, and power sockets on most seats
(including mine -- I chose my seat for that reason). This means that I
can use my laptop for the 13-hour 45-minute flight. :)</p>
<p>I've decided to do this blog post piecemeal; I'm writing stuff as it
occurs to me. That's easier than trying to remember everything at the
end. I'll probably be switching between present and past tense, though.
It's currently one hour into the flight.</p>
<p>At 4 hours, I'm listening to current French pop songs. It seems that as
long as I can't understand the lyrics, I enjoy popular music a lot more.
(yes, I can speak French, but picking out lyrics in the middle of a song
is beyond me, especially when I'm deliberately not trying to listen.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately all is not sweets and roses on this flight. The LCD is
nice, but a number of features -- include the "Map" menu -- are not
functioning. The error message is polite, but I wanted to see where we
were on the map, how far we'd travelled to date, etc.</p>
<p>7 hours now. I don't feel too bad, which is good 'cause it's only half
over. The thin slippers that Dad brought back from Japan (they was an
omake for some first-class train tickets) help a lot. They're coming
around with hot beverages, which will be followed by dinner. There's
still one more meal coming; 2 hours before the end, they give out hot
noodles. I've never been on a flight with three meals and six or seven
drinks before... but then again, I've never been on a 13.75 hour flight.
I was surprised by the amount of localization. Hot drinks include green
tea, and the standard chicken hot lunch meal came with chopsticks. I'm
not surprised because this doesn't make sense; I'm just surprised that
the business is flexible enough to have different meals on different
international flights.</p>
<p>I underestimated the amount of suckage involved in working on an
airplane -- and the amount that I normally fidget. It's not unusual for
me to have a foot on my desk, for example. Not in the classic "fat cat"
pose, though. My laptop is on the desk like normal, and I kind-of slouch
sideways. With one leg contorted around. Anyway, as of 12 hours, I've
gotten about 5 hours of work done. Spent 5 hours watching movies/TV
shows and/or eating, and about 2 hours of snoozing.</p>
<p>Hong Kong airport wasn't fun, since the first flight was delayed and
they had poor signage. Seriously, who names the international tranfer
flight check-in area "W1"? Also, either Air Canada shouldn't have
printed my second boarding pass, or the security guard should have
accepted it and not made me jog off to get a new one printed. I entered
the security line-up at the time I was supposed to be at the gate for
boarding. But after a bit more jogging, I arrived on the second plane.</p>
<p>The second flight was uninteresting in terms of airplane model (IIRC it
was a 777), food, entertainment, lack of sights (pitch black and me not
near a window anyway). I dozed for a bit.</p>
<p>Singapore airport was a model of efficiency; within 20 minutes of
stepping out of the airplane, I was stepping out of the airport. The
customs girl was very nice and smiled at me as I stuttered through my
explanation of my job (she had previously asked when I was starting my
studies, since I look so much like a student). She waved away my attempt
to show her my exiting flight (you're required to show proof of the next
destination if they ask).</p>
<p>The baggage carousel was actually the most nerve-wracking part. In the
future, I think I might get some yellow paint and draw a huge happy face
on the suitcase or something... there were just too many black
suitcases.</p>
<p>Of course, the airport experience might be quite different if I hadn't
arrived at midnight with nothing else arriving. Then again, my
supervisor (the one here, not my old supevisor) says that he's travelled
in over 40 countries, and the Singapore airport is the best.</p>
<p>Taxi ride was ok. A woman on the flight in said that it would be "really
really expensive... like S$30" and tried to think of other ways I could
get to my apartment, but in the end agreed that since the MRT was closed
and there probably wasn't a direct bus, it wasn't worth it. The taxi
ended up being S$40.20, but the driver gave me S$10 back when I handed
him a S$50 and waved off my apologies for not having any coins. I
figured that S$40 wasn't bad for a 35-minute drive mostly exceeding
100km/h. I definitely couldn't get a deal like that in Vancouver!</p>
<p>Impressions of the city at night: looked like any metropolist in North
America. There's a huge port, lots of construction, big skyscrapers.</p>
<p>First impression upon stepping out of the taxi: sweet mao it's hot. And
it's past midnight!</p>
<p>There wasn't anybody around when I arrived at my apartment, but the
security was very nice and friendly, and called up the manager. She came
down after five minutes, and was very friendly and got me checked in. I
got the info for wireless, but my computer wasn't set up to deal with
their particular encryption scheme (WEP), so I'm still just typing this
and will send tomorrow from the university.</p>
<p>Arrival at room, 1:30am. I spent an hour writing blog posts, emails, and
attempting to get the wireless working.</p>

<p>Overall impression: Singaporeans are extremely nice and helpful. The
manager didn't show any signs of minding being woken up at 1am (she
thought I was arriving tomorrow), the security guy didn't give me any
glares for not knowing what I was doing, the only reactions to my braid
(that I detected) was occasional mild curiosity, and the customs agent
didn't transform into a tentacle monster and rip apart my paperwork and
suitcases.</p>
