<p>I forgot the power cord for my laptop at NUS on the second day, was too

<div class="section" id="second-day-thursday">
<h2>Second day - Thursday</h2>
<p>On the second day, I had breakfast at a cafe called "The Grinning
Gecko", overlooking a jungle mini-valley at NUS. You'll be amazed at the
pictures when they come probably next Sat. I had their breakfast set C,
which consisted of eggs, toast, chicken bacon, lettuce, and a tomoto. I
also had some mango lemonaid, which tasted ridiculously good.</p>
<p>I then filled out more forms, collected a PC from tech support and a mac
mini from my supervisor's other lab, and met most of the other people in
the research group.</p>
<p>I've never been in a research group before. Sure, at UVic there were a
bunch of people who occasionally worked on projects together and some of
whom sat in the same room, but it wasn't like this. Dr. Wang's group
gets together to play sports and have spring music evenings and stuff.
They even eat lunch together!</p>
<p>Speaking of which, the first lunch was a disaster. They all got Chinese
food, so I followed suit, but that particular stall was out of
vegetarian dishes, so somebody suggested something with chicken in it.
For those who don't know me, I'm very picky about meat. Fatty or bloody
parts trigger my gag reflex. This chicken dish was not composed of pure
breast meat. I managed to choke down about half of it.</p>
<p>Oh, and you know those little spoon-like things that you use with
chopsticks to pick up hard-to-get pieces of spoons? I thought they were
spoons, so I took one and left the chopsticks alone. Score another point
for ignorant Westeners! (if anybody knows what those spoon-things are
called, I'm curious)</p>
<p>In the afternoon I got a walking tour of NUS from my supervisor and
discussed research plans in general. He also commented that I was very
overdressed (black jeans and an olive button-up shirt), and that nobody
at NUS cared how you were dressed and he could even give lectures in
what he was wearing. That relieved me, since I'd noticed that working
Singaporeans all wore buttoned shirts, but I figured it was better to
make an initial impression as being too smartly dressed rather than
insufficiently dressed.</p>
<p>For dinner, I went back to the same food court but had pasta (spaghetti)
from the "Western" stall. Their notation of "Western" seems to resolve
around fried chicken, and included a few dishes that definitely weren't
Western... but pasta definitely qualifies. It was very cheap (S$1.80,
which is about CDN$2.00 or US$2.25), but I discovered that it didn't
have any meatballs in the sauce.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="third-day-friday">
<h2>Third day - Friday</h2>
<p>opened a bank account. I then had the same breakfast as as the second
day, followed by more forms.</p>
<p>The morning ended with a presentation to 33 high school students from a
"top high school" -- evidently Singapore does the sensible thing and
streams students, instead of the silly Canadian system where everybody
goes to the same schools. Anyway, he gave a short presentation about
music computer research. As part of that, I inserted a mini-lesson about
the relationship between frequency and string length, mass, and tension.
He had the formula on the slide, but I figured that a one-minute speech
with violin demonstrations wouldn't hurt. The kids even predicted what
would happen when I put my finger halfway along the string... although
in retrospect, grade 12 students aren't stupid. If I couldn't have done
that by grade 8 -- even without having played cello -- I'd have been
mortified.</p>
<p>I also criticized the slides just before the presentation. One slide in
particular had a lot of black text and was unnecessarily confusing. I
suggested removing some text (in particular, "music -- appreciation --
ears -- brain". You can't appreciate music until it's reached your ears,
let alone your brain!), as well as adding some colours. After the
presentations, I also sent more criticisms to him.</p>
<p>I was a bit cautious about my initial comments, because some people
don't like criticism, but he loved it. That was a great relief for me,
since I hate working with people who don't like criticisms. Eventually I
stop making suggestions to avoid upsetting them, and then I just sit and
stew with the knowledge that I could have made things better. But that
isn't the case here; I definitely made a positive impression with my
suggestions.</p>
<p>I also wrote a long email with suggestions and links for the mobile
device orchestra. They were using the accelerometers in the ipod touch
to trigger drum sounds. Some of you may remember my performance of the
Swan and Rachminoff's Vocalise while I was an undergraduate student at
UVic. It seems like I'll be returning to that kind of work, which is
nice -- this was the first area of music technology that I pursued.</p>
<p>For lunch, I tried the Indian stall and got something that looked like a
big, thick crepe. It might have been mashed potatoes covered in batter,
although that sounds a bit weird. It came with some sauce which was
somewhat spicy.</p>
<p>For dinner, I didn't eat before I left campus, since I'd spent all my
cash on my initial bank balance deposit (actually, I had to withdraw
some cash from my Canadian debit card... I shudder to think of the bank
charges I incurred in doing so), and the first bank machine I visited
was out of cash. So I started walking along the main street in front of
my apartment, and eventually (10-15 minutes?) arrived at a shopping
plaza. It had a McDonalds, which I started to walk towards, but then I
noticed a pizza hut sign.</p>
<p>I got a regular (9") pepporoni pizza. It was S$16 (including drink),
which is ridiculously expensive by Singapore food prices, but I figured
that I deserved a treat. I think this might become my standard Friday
night thing... it's too expensive to have on a regular basis, but I was
dangerously low on one of the main food groups (grease), and it felt
very good to stuff myself.</p>

<div class="section" id="fourth-day-saturday">
<h2>Fourth day - Saturday</h2>
<p>My normal breakfast place at NUS was closed, so I went straight to the
lab and started working. After about half an hour, some more people
arrived. Just as I was going to leave to have breakfast (about 10:30am),
my supervisor arrived. He was horrified that I hadn't eaten yet, so he
took me to eat. We went to a Chinese stall, and I got him to order
something vegetarian for me. Apparently at this stall, you get rice plus
X side dishes, so he simply pointed at three different vegetables. There
were some asparagus-like things that were quite good. I think they were
a type of bean?</p>
<p>More discussion about research projects followed, and in the afternoon I
finished proofreading my second paper and started looking at iPhone/iPod
touch development. Around 2pm I went and got lunch at the Subway on
campus, and by 3pm I headed home to sleep.</p>
<p>I dozed for a few hours, but then woke up at 7pm and went to find more
food locally. I found a food court almost immediately, but it was really
intimating -- very noisy, everybody speaking non-English (and non-French
and non-Japanese) languages, and not a scrap of English on the signs for
each stall. I ignored that area and kept on walking.</p>
<p>After 5-10 minutes of walking, I discovered another food court, but this
time I went in. The best bet seemed like a Muslim or Indian place, where
I got some small pancake-looking things. Judging from a quick glance at
wikipedia, it was naan. Anyway, that came with a soup (or maybe just
runny curry?). I tried dipping the pancake-like thing in the soup, which
seemed quite nice. I have no clue if that's what I was supposed to do,
but it seemed to work.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fifth-day-sunday">
<h2>Fifth day - Sunday</h2>
<p>I'd decided early on -- actually, I meant to add this to my resolutions
for Singapore -- that I wouldn't go in to university on the "day of
rest". That was reserved to catching up on lilypond, writing blogs, and
housework. (Mao, it's already 16:15!)</p>
<p>My MRT station is almost at the end of the line, and I'd heard that
there was a big shopping centre at the end, so I went there. I also
needed to buy a SIM card for the phone my supervisor lent to me, and I
figured this could count for my "tourist thing of the week".</p>
<p>I ended up having breakfast at Burger King. As per usual with Western
food places, a meal comes to around S$7. That might not sound too bad
(and it certainly isn't), but complete meals at non-Western places are
generally S$3 or S$4. And you know that I'm a ridiculous skinflint.</p>
<p>I returned to my apartment, then set out for lunch. I went slightly
farther than last night, since I'd heard that there was a mall there. I
found the mall, then went to a food court. I got some sugar cane juice.
This is produced by putting a length of sugar cane through a juicer.
Like, right there and then. Fresh squeezed sugar cane juice!</p>
<p>It turned out to be quite bad. Somehow it had the consistency of milk,
with a sugary taste. Almost like strawberry-flavored milk, but...
somehow wrong. I'm sure it could be an aquired taste, though. Anyway, to
choke that down, I found a vegetarian food place and asked for rice and
2 veg, then pointed at two of the vegetables I'd had for breakfast on
Sat (including the bean-like things). To make life more interesting, I
tried using chopsticks.</p>
<p>I really should have learned how to use chopsticks before coming to
Asia. I'll have to ask somebody to teach me at lunch tomorrow.</p>
