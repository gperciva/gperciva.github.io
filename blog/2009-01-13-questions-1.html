<p>I'm going to answer a bunch of emailed questions in this blog post,
under the time-honoured teacher theory that if one person asks a
question, 10 more were thinking it.</p>
<p>Singapore has an extensive public transit system. The main backbone is
the MRT (Mass Rapid Transit), which is a mostly-above-ground subway.
There's a single prepaid card you use for both the MRT and busses, which
makes travel very convenient. You tap the card when you enter and exit,
and you're charged based on the number of stops you travelled. I haven't
seen any car rental places, but there's lots of taxis around. Getting to
NUS involve 10 minutes on the MRT and 15 minutes on a bus.</p>
<p>Singapore food portions tend to be smaller than Canadian ones, so I'm
generally hungry even with 3 meals a day. That's not necessarily a bad
thing -- it makes the food I do eat seem much more tasty. For example,
the best pasta I've ever had in my life was S$2.00 (or about CDN$1.80
and US$1.60 -- I got the exchange rate the wrong way around in the last
post).</p>
<p>I'm using my eee strictly for personal business. Some days I don't even
bring it to NUS, although luckily I brought it today (I'm in a seminar
which just had two Chinese speakers). I only turn on the windows
computer when I need to proofread somebody else's papers. So most of my
life is spent on the Mac Mini running OSX 10.5.</p>
<p>The research group has 15 people. I think there's approximately 3
undergrads (NUS has undergrads doing significant research -- the speaker
just now said it was a full year of undergraduate research, which seems
incredibly high). Maybe something like 3 Masters students, 6 PhD
students, 3 PostDoc / Research Assistants... plus the professor. Ok,
subtract 1 from one of the above numbers. Other than me, everybody is
Chinese or Singaporean with Chinese ancestry.</p>
<p>The violin in the lab was bought a few years ago, and had sensors put on
it. They hired a few musicians to play it, while they videotaped it and
did bow-tracking or something like that.</p>
<p>The mobile device orchestra will of course be videotaped. I'll try to
get it posted online, but at the very minimum I'm sure I can bring a
copy back to Vancouver.</p>
<p>The proofreading was proofing other people's papers. I can communicate
fairly easily with people in the group, but even the best English
speakers here do things like writing "for buffering mechanism". (either
missing an "a" or an "s")</p>
<p>The apartment has a rice cooker, kettle, and a hot plate. I've found a
local supermarket and a "mini-mart". I haven't bought anything yet, and
I'm not certain if I'll bother. I mean, eating out is so cheap, and has
no hassle of cooking or cleaning up. This was in the local mall, which
had other stores at well.</p>
<p>Weather is a mixture of sun and cloud, and probably constant between 25
and 30. The past few days have felt a lot better than the first few
days, but I'm not certain whether that's due to me wearing shorts and
white t-shirts, getting used to the climate, or any actual change in
temperature. I saw two brief (less than 1 minute) rain showers, but no
real rain yet.</p>
