<p>More misc updates. Photos are taken, loaded into Picasa on my university
computer, and waiting for some brief descriptions and being uploaded. I
might even skip the descriptions. Basically, all I need is ten minutes
at my computer when it won't look like I'm goofing off.</p>
<p>Friday had initial project meetings. I managed to cancel one project
when I pointed out a bunch of previous work, including commercial X-box
games. This leaves me with two projects: a mobile music-making project
which involves me, two students, and three professors, and my
mewer-for-ipod game. Tweaked a bit to use jianpu notation (also known as
"numbered musical notation" or "simple musical notation"). I'll have fun
getting LilyPond to output this stuff!</p>
<p>Saturdays are apparently the normal group meetings. I presented my
Master's defense to 14 people (there was one extra professor, but two
group members hadn't arrived yet), followed by a normal day of work. I
guess that's one way to get students to work an extra day! I got home at
7pm or so.</p>
<p>On Sunday (my "tourist" day) I went to NUS to take pictures for you
guys. I then started doing a bit of work, which turned into inviting the
other people (about half the group was there!) to dinner, which turned
into accepting an invitation to visit a nearby person's apartment, which
turned into getting home at 8pm. I also didn't fall asleep until past
1am.</p>
<p>Monday sucked, so I left "early" (around 4:30pm) and ended up sleeping
for 12 hours. That's my traditional warning sign, so I'm going to cut
back on working hours. I must admit that I'm quite confident in my
productivity, and my supervisor told me that he values results rather
than the amount of time spent, so it was actually quite stupid of me to
try to spend the same amount of time working as other people. I might
even try to convince them to work harder for less time... no, wait.
That'll never work. I just need to lead by example. It probably still
won't work, but at least I can try.</p>
<p>On to other matters... electronics are expensive here! I thought that
Singapore was supposed to have cheap gear, but prices here are higher
than Canada! Not that Canada is particularly expensive... but I was
looking forward to buying stuff here, and I'd never buy things unless
they were on sale. For reference, the Asus eeePC 1000 (10-inch screen,
intel Atom, etc) is S$888 here, and CDN$ 500 in Canada. S$888 -&gt;
CDN$750. I suppose that just fits into my personal exemption for import
duties... but why buy it here? I'll get it when I'm home!</p>
<p>I found some instant milk tea packets. "Milk tea" is what they call
English tea here. Now, I know you're all thinking "that sounds
completely disgusting"... and to be honest, that's what I thought when I
saw it... but they're actually not terrible. Don't get me wrong; they're
definitely not <strong>good</strong>. But they satisfy my tea cravings.</p>
<p>Next weekend is Chinese new year. This is a <strong>huge</strong> thing over here.
Bigger than Christmas in Canada. Stores are closed for 2-3 days. Even
the supermarket -- I need to stock up on food on Friday or Sat,
otherwise I'd starve. :( This is a problem, since I've been eating out
for all my meals. Hey, at S$2 per meal, that's not luxury. University is
of course closed, and the bus from the MRT to university isn't running.
I couldn't go in to get work done even if I wanted to! (which I do,
actually -- it would probably be nice and quiet)</p>
