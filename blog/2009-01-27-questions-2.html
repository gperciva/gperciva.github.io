<p>More answers to emailed questions.</p>
<p>Yes, I've definitely been getting work down. The jianqu version of MEWER
is almost complete -- I reached the point where I know how to do all of
the iphone interface stuff I need, so it's time to rewrite my project
with proper software engineering practices, instead of throwing
everything together.</p>
<p>On Friday, we were finally able to purchase the iphone developer
license. It took Apple a full week to fix their Apple Store so that we
could purchase it from Singapore. I could buy the license by ssh'ing
into a computer at UVic that I still had access to and using lynx.
Text-based SSL-encrypted web-browsing for teh win! But I didn't want to
buy the license myself, since I'm leaving this group in four months.
It's more useful if one of the PhD students here buys it.</p>
<p>Anyway, that prompted a flurry of activity on Saturday when we could
actually begin testing. I immediately tried to do a trill -- none of the
other people thought to try this, but it was obvious to me as a musician
that this was the best way to test the overall system -- and was
disgusted at the results. But after half an hour (with corrections to
both the client and the server) we had it working quite well.</p>
<p>As a side note, I'm not impressed with MVC (model-controller-view). I
definitely see the point in separating the logic from the interface, but
I just can't see a separate Controller as being truly useful. I mean,
how many people really use multiple interfaces for exactly the same
code? I've written the rhythm game three times now, and each time I've
had to use a different language (1. Qt - C++ (or java or python with
bindings) 2. haXe (to create flash or javascript) 3. objective C (for
iphone)).</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">I'm even less impressed with Objective C. "Hey, let's take a language
with well-known syntax relying on () for functions, and add syntax
which relies on [] for functions in objects!" Seriously, you have code
like this:</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
for (int i = 0; i &lt; exerciseString.length; i++) {
  int c = [exerciseString charAtIndex:i];
  if (c==49) {
    [arrayExerciseOnsets addObject:[NSNumber valueFromInt:1]];
    int x = (480 - xOffsetR - xOffsetL) / exerciseString.length;
    CGDrawRectangle (ctx, x, 0, 2, 50);
  }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
<div class="line">Yuck! Ok, my use of a "magic number" is bad, but '1' doesn't work due
to the magic of UTF-8 string handling. Specifying the ASCII value
*does* work. Also, I'm mixing Model and View stuff here -- I'm not
actually doing this in my program; I artificially dumped them together
so you could see the wonders of [objective C] with pure C
object-oriented code... all directly from the Apple docs. I mean, the
Objective-C [object method:parameter] syntax is silly enough, but when
they encourage you to use CoreGraphics with the pure C-style
<tt class="docutils literal">CGFooBar( pointer_to_drawing_context, my, real, parameters);</tt> ...
I'm left shaking my head in disbelief.</div>

<p>Back to normal life! The most complicated meal I've made so far is
tuna-fish melt. Sliced bread, tuna, and a slice of processed cheese,
into a microwave for 30 seconds, and then adding ketchup. If I could
find macaroni and cheese here, or if the street food wasn't so cheap,
I'd do more cooking. But there really isn't any point in it -- if all
the stores weren't closed for the LNY, I wouldn't have even bothered
with the tuna-fish.</p>
<p>Singapore TV seems to be sit-com-like dramas. I saw a TV schedule by
reading a magazine over the shoulder of somebody in the MRT once, and it
listed Battle Star Galactica as being on at 11pm, but I didn't stay
awake to check. There's 8 or 9 channels, and every time I've tried to
look for something all the shows have been news or been Asian dramas
(mostly in Chinese (or maybe Malay?), occasionally in Indian (or maybe
Indonesian?)). They have subtitles -- often in two languages, so I could
follow along if I wanted to. Oh wait; once I saw that BBC comedy with
the mute comedian. Mr. Bean? It was on air about 10-15 years ago.</p>
