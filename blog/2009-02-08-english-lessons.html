<p>I held my first English session on Friday. It seemed to go fairly well,
although I won't really know until I see their papers.</p>
<p>I told everybody write a 1-page introduction to a (possibly fictional)
academic paper. On Friday, we all gave our papers to somebody else to
peer edit. Next Friday, they'll do the same thing (after fixing
mistakes), or hand it in to me.</p>
<p>I tried to scare them by emphasizing that it's a waste of my time to fix
spelling mistakes or grammatical mistakes -- almost all of them have
enough English skills that they can fix those things. Instead, I should
be working on issues of organization and style -- pointing out how to
make things sound more natural. I warned them that if I found obvious
spelling or grammatical mistakes, I wouldn't spend any time on the more
interesting issues, and they would have wasted their chance to get
useful feedback from me.</p>
<p>I added a page to the group's wiki: <a class="reference external" href="http://m3r.comp.nus.edu.sg/wiki/index.php/English">English
sessions</a>. If you
have any suggestions for other things to do, I'm all for it. My current
plan is to do the same thing every Friday.</p>
<p>Oh, and I also wrote a 1-page paper introduction. Mine was about a
fictional "tongue-based music browsing" project. It started as a total
spoof, but now I actually think it might be a worthwhile paper to do.
I'm certain it could be published in ISMIR... unless somebody else has
already done it. I didn't bother looking for any related work. :)</p>
<p>Oh yeah, one final note: so that the person proofreading my work
wouldn't get too bored, I deliberately added a number of mistakes to my
paper. I aimed for common mistakes that I've noticed in their own
writing. Test your own proofreading skills! See how many errors you can
find in <a class="reference external" href="http://percival-music.ca/blogfiles/tongue-browsing.pdf">Tip o' the
Tongue</a>!</p>
