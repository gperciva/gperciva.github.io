<p>I finally got around to uploading the pictures from my "tourist trip" to
the so-called Chinese Gardens. They're a 3-minute walk from my
apartment, so I figured it would be an easy way to satisfy my "tourist
thing" without involving too much hassle. I have to say, though, I was
underwhelmed.</p>
<p>The grounds themselves reminded me of Vanier Park -- that's the park in
Vancouver that's next to the museum, planetarium, and the Vancouver
Academy of Music. It has same kind of grassy hills, light forest, a few
streams and ponds, etc. Granted, the architecture of the buildings is
different... but I didn't find that to be such a big deal.</p>
<p>The Chinese Gardens also contained a "Live tortoise and turtle museum",
which was every bit as boring as it sounds. I'm really starting to
re-evaluate my whole "do one tourist thing each week" -- I'm a terrible
tourist. I mean, I'd never dream of going to a zoo or temple or special
waterfall or whatnot in Canada, so why on earth am I forcing myself to
do that here?</p>
<p>In a similar vein, my "tourist activity" tomorrow (this report is 6 days
late) is running around the nearby lake. I don't know how long it is...
when I glanced at a map, it looked smaller than Burnaby Lake (which is
11.6km around), but now I'm wondering if it's actually bigger. I should
know tomorrow; if it takes me more than an hour to get around it, it's
definitely bigger than Burnaby Lake. (to my family: yes, I'm definitely
taking a water bottle with me. And this first time, I'm not going to do
my "absolutely cannot stop for any reason" thing. I'll stop, drink, look
at any maps that are posted, etc.)</p>
