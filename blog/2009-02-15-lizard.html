<p>I just got back from the bathroom (no, don't worry, I'm not turning this
into twitter), where I had a huge shock (ok, that sounds even worse). As
I lifted up the hand-towel to dry my hands, a lizard shot up the wall
from behind the towel!</p>
<p>It was about 5cm long (including tail), and pale brown. And it was fast.
It moved about 30cm before I let out my gasp and jumped backwards. Ok,
granted I was too startled to react instantly... but it was fast. I
think I could beat it if we were running 10 meters or more, but its
acceleration was amazing. And it was quite at home running sideways
along a wall.</p>
<p>This is the first time (that I recall) that I've seen a lizard in real
life. And I'm on the 8th floor! I wouldn't freak out if I saw one in the
jungle, in the park bathroom (they're quite open, I guess to allow
breezes through), or at NUS (where there's jungle mixed with corridors.
But I didn't expect to see one after midnight in my apartment! Moths,
sure, but not a lizard!</p>
