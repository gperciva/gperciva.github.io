<p>Nothing particularly earth-shattering in this post.</p>
<p>As mentioned previous, I bought some sandals. I only worn them to
university for one day, because the straps were painfully wearing away
my skin. Is this normal for sandals? I don't think I've worn them since
I was 10 or so. Is it just because I bought cheap ones, or because the
skin on the top of my feet isn't calloused enough, or do sandals just
have a painful "wear-in" period?</p>
<p>I want cheese. Real cheese, not the plasticy stuff. I know, I've been
told where to look for it (Cold Storage, Marketplace, Carre Four), but I
haven't had any time. And I don't expect to find the time until after
April 17. :(</p>
<p>On a more positive note, I was complaining about the lack of pizza to my
project members, and one of them suggested the Munchy Monkey. I think
it's a student pub or something; it's a bit classier than the normal
food places on campus. But it did indeed have pizza! S$ 7.00 for a small
pizza. Compared to the S$ 2 or S$ 2.50 that a normal Chinese meal costs
this may seem like a lot, but it's definitely worth it to me! Besides, I
doubt I could find a similar pizza in Canada for CDN$ 6.00. This easily
doubles the attractiveness of NUS.</p>
<p>I tried running around Jurong lake last week -- this is the lake that's
right beside my house. Unfortunately, the street at the south side of
the lake doesn't have any pedestrian access -- no sidewalks, no
causeways, etc. So I had to turn around and home, dispirited. I mean,
it's one thing to force yourself to jog around a specific area (such as
a lake); it's another thing to force yourself to jog just for the sake
of jogging. I don't know if I'll try jogging again in Singapore.</p>
<p>Singapore websites are quite unfriendly. Lots of javascript and flash,
which means that 1) they're slow to download, 2) they're slow to render
on a low-powered machine like this laptop, and 3) they often simply
don't work in a standard-compliant web-browser.</p>
<p>I need to get a book about Chinese humor or something, because nobody
here understands my jokes. For example, there's a Chinese folk /
children's song called "Dance of Youth". I started calling it "Dance of
Wolves", since they sound a bit familiar. Then I tried calling it
"Silence of the Lambs", and everybody just stared at me with stone-cold
faces. People back in Vancouver would understand! ... ok, maybe not
"people", but at least my brother would get that one.</p>
<p>My attempted pop culture references also fail. I started talking about
creating one monolithic application instead of having a dozen individual
applications, and they asked what "monolithic" was. I tried to explain
what a monolith was ("remember that huge black stone at the beginning of
2001? ... you know, that really famous space movie...?") and had an epic
fail. "Do you mean star wars?"</p>
<p>Of course, it's my fault for trying to jazz things up. I also find
myself using common English phrases -- "putting the cart before the ox",
"my bark is worse than my bite", etc. I don't know why; it's just part
of my instinctive "I should act this way in this situation". I mean,
nothing says that instincts are always right, but unless I have any
particular reason to doubt them, I act on them. I mean, that's what
instincts are, eh?</p>

<p>This week's English mini-paper was about computer-assisted composition
and classical musicians: <a class="reference external" href="http://percival-music.ca/blogfiles/friendly-music.pdf">Fixing the Unfriendliness of Classical
Music</a>. Can
you find the pattern of mistakes?</p>
