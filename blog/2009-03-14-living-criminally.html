<p>Wow, it's been a while! I've been sick, had a huge deadline, and got
slightly better. Still not great health, but at least it doesn't hurt at
the moment. Anyway, a friend from Vancouver visited me... err... two and
a half weeks ago?</p>
<p>It was weird how un-weird it was. I mean, when you meet somebody on the
other side of the world -- the only non-electronic connection to your
normal life back home that you're likely to get during your entire stay
here -- you'd expect it to be weird, right? Or at emotional or
something?</p>
<p>But no, there was none of that. I arrived at the meeting place --
arranged via email, since he didn't have a phone here -- a few minutes
late, looked around at the dozen people sitting at the tables, then
decided he hadn't arrived yet. As I started to walk away (to be closer
to the entrance), he stood up and followed me. Whoops; I'd completely
missed him. (in my defense, I must say that his pink shirt did not suit
him!)</p>
<p>"Hey." "Hey." ... pause... "Wanna go get some pizza?" "Sure, I'm
starving".</p>
<p>I talked about the lack of familiar food; he talked about Malaysian
hotels screwing up his laundry. I talked about my work environment; he
talked about almost dying in Bangkok. It was just like normal! OK,
medical emergencies weren't normal... but despite the topic, the tone of
the conversation was normal.</p>
<p>He was amazed at the lack of smell in Singapore. Also at how clean it
was, and how we had sidewalks. The latter two points didn't surprise me,
but I hadn't realized that a lack of stench was a big plus for urban
centers. I guess it's a good thing that I'm not sight-seeing in the
nearby countries. :)</p>
<p>Mao, I miss Victoria (aka "Bunny Land"). IMO, Singapore (and Vancouver)
do smell. Not in a "garbage stench" kind of way; just in a "lots of cars
and stuff" way. I think I've turned into a "small town" guy rather than
a "big city" guy.</p>
<p>Anyway, I showed him my place. His first reaction was "this amount of
space is criminal", which stuck in my mind and turned into the title of
this post. He's now in Japan... I wonder how criminal he thinks this
place is now. ;)</p>
<p>Let's see... not much else has been happening, other than work. Oh, a
woman asked me for directions. I didn't realize that I looked anything
close to being a local. Then again, maybe that prompted her to approach
me. I mean, the only reason an obvious foreigner would have to be in a
residential district would be if he lived there, so I'd obviously know
where the local supermarket was. Anyway, I directed her and assume she
found the right place.</p>
<p>I might actually restart my attempts at doing touristy things on
Sunday... due to my health issues, I've been home this weekend (instead
of working on Sat), and it feels much better. If I make this a regular
occurence, then I can use Sat for rest and catching up on email, and Sun
for touristy stuff. We'll see how things go in the next few weeks.</p>
