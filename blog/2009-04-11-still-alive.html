<p>Wow, it's been a while! I've been sick, had a huge deadline, and got
slightly better. No, this isn't an exact repeat of the last update...
although it somewhat feels like it.</p>
<p>My sickness this time was just a common cold/flu thing, caused from lack
of food. Eating enough food here is a serious concern. I've taken to
going to Subway or Burger King almost every day, just to make sure I
have at least one normal meal. When I spent last Tuesday in bed, I even
switched to coke rather than diet coke, just to increase my calory
intake. Yeah, I know that fast food and soda being the "healthy
alternatives" says really sad things about my ability to forage in this
country.</p>
<p>On the plus side, I'm almost finished the big project. After that, I'll
only work 5 days a week. That should give me more energy to explore the
island (including the more Western-oriented food stores, Western hangout
areas, etc).</p>
<p>Apparently one of my grandmothers checks the Singapore weather every
day. That's nice, but completely unnecessary -- every day is the same.
It's 29 plus or minus 2 degrees. There's an 80% chance of the day being
entirely sunny. If it rains, there's a 50% chance of it being a downpour
that lasts for about an hour. 25% chance of only a mild shower, and 25%
chance of it being a downpour that lasts for 2-3 hours. Any downpour is
accompanied by thunderstorms.</p>
<p>Perfect example of how unnecessary the weather prediction is: the
evening news doesn't even bother to report it. In Canada, every newscast
contains a weather report. I wish there <em>was</em> some variation in weather
to report, though. :(</p>
<p>Actually, wait; there <em>is</em> one extra point. When it really downpours
here, I can't see the buildings on the other side of the lake outside my
apartment. Even the trees about 10 meters away from my window are
noticeably obscured. It's like having a thick fog, but I'm pretty sure
it's just from the descending water rather than floating water.</p>
<p>Other "news"... to celebrate the almost-finished project, I bought some
Toblerone chocolate. Normally I'm too cheap to buy blatant chocolate
like that, but it was on sale, and I wanted to celebrate. So I splurged
S$7.</p>
<p>That's not so much "news" as just an illustration of my life here --
nothing's been happening. I'm not complaining, by the way. I <em>want</em> my
daily life to be boring; it's my research that should be interesting.
I'd talk about that, but I'm not certain how much interest there is in
hearing about it... and in any case, I should probably wait until the
reviews are done.</p>
<p>I had a few other random observations to make, but I can't remember them
now. Oh well; when this project is finished in a few days, I should be
posting more often.</p>
<hr class="docutils">
<p>Only 47 days until I return to Vancouver! And before everybody tells me
what I should see in Japan on the way, let me remind you that my
connecting flight is 2 hours and 20 minutes after I arrive in Narita. So
unless you want to tell me about a particularly interesting shop in the
International departure lounge at Narita (any maid cafes there? 'cause
that would be awesome!), don't bother. :)</p>
<p>I'm somewhat regretting this choice -- two of my closest friends are in
Japan right now, and it'd be neat to visit them. But I'm not going to
cancel my air tickets... and besides, I miss my mountains and cat.</p>
