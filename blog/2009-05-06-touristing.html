<p>For the last two weekends, I did touristy stuff: visiting the Jurong
Bird Park, and Sentosa Island. I also watched X-men: Wolverine and Xmen
III: the Last Stand, thereby filling in some horrifying gaps in my
education. Also,
<a class="reference external" href="https://picasaweb.google.com/107782479450604073806/">pictures</a>.</p>
<p>Before going to the bird park -- that's a zoo just for birds -- I tried
to do the responsible thing in buying a hat and some sunglasses.
However, either the nearest big mall (Jurong Point, maybe 80% the size
of Metrotown in Burnaby) failed me, or I fail at shopping. I spent an
hour wandering around the mall, but couldn't find any non-designer
sunglasses, and the only hats I found were either designer fashion
things, or fishing hats from a sport store. I just wanted cheap, ugly
sunglasses, and maybe one of those straw hats. I figured I could find
them easily in Canada for $5-$10 each.</p>
<p>I found a ridiculous number of handbag stores, though. Granted, in my
mind, "a ridiculous number of handbag stores" means "more than 1 per
100,000 people" or so... but still, I really can't figure the interest.
Clothes, sure. I mean, there was a lot of those -- especially a lot of
generic upscale clothing stores, with only two or three dozen dresses --
but those make sense. You change clothes at least once a day. But
handbags? Especially ugly box-like handbags that could almost hold a
basketball?! How many of those do women need?</p>
<p>As an aside, it's a pity I don't have a girlfriend. At the local mall
(not the big one; this one has about 30 shops), I keep on seeing
nice-looking dresses in temporary stalls in the hallway for S$ 10. I
doubt you could buy a pair of female socks in Canada for that price, let
alone an actual dress! It seems like a shame to pass up this bargain...
then again, I couldn't imagine myself buying dresses without a girl by
my side, even if I <em>did</em> have a girlfriend in Vancouver to give them to.
Given that I have long hair in a braid, I think that people here might
misunderstand...</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>Ok, actual impressions about the Jurong Bird Park. First impression: wow
these things are colorful. I mean, "fake animal"-type colorful. You just
don't get vibrant colors like these in Canadian wildlife, so my first
instinct upon seeing many of these was to think of a child's coloring
book, when they haven't learned that animals have dull colors to aid in
camoflage.</p>
<p>I have no clue how these tropical birds manage to survive in the
wilderness. I mean, it's like blaring out "hey, tasty snack here!" to
all the cats. Then again, I can't imagine panthers bothering with some
of these small birds, and I don't know if housecat-sized cats live in
the jungle.</p>
<p>BTW, if you didn't follow the link to my
<a class="reference external" href="https://picasaweb.google.com/107782479450604073806/">pictures</a>, I
would recommend it now. I didn't take many photos, since I couldn't
figure out how to turn of flash, and the batteries were running out. But
there's a few nice ones there.</p>
<p>I discovered what must be one of nature's most ridiculous animals: the
rhinocerus hornbill. I didn't take a photo, but here's a link to the
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinoceros_Hornbill">wikipedia page</a>,
including photos. I have no clue what the third beak is for.</p>
<p>I also saw some ginormous (gynormous? sp?) pigeons -- almost twice as
big as my cat. Sadly the photos of them didn't turn out too well; there
was no convenient size marker to show how big they are. They just look
like birds sitting in a jungle; the surrounding foliage could be at any
scale, so it doesn't help in showing how huge these things were.</p>
<p>They had a penguin pond in an air-conditioned building (behind some
glass, so I would guess that their area was even colder). I finally saw
the way that penguins fly underwater, which was neat.</p>
<p>The "birds of prey" section was slightly disappointing. Ok, there were
some big creatures there... but some of them were smaller than the
pigeons! This was more a case of unrealistic expectations; after seeing
the hornbill, the monster pigeons, and the child-colored felt birds in
the "lorry loft", I was expecting fire-breathing monsters that could
take on fully-armoured knights, instead of eagles. Oh, for any Americans
out there: yes, they had two bald eagles.</p>
<p>I was impressed by the vegetation. Each cage was set up appropriately
(or "approximately appropriately") for their normal terrain, so
sometimes you had thick jungle next to desert.</p>
<p>There was one section devoted to an African rainforest and those birds;
it was a huge cage that you could hike around inside. That was actually
quite nostalgic -- with a surprisingly little bit of imagination, I
could pretend that I was in British Columbia. Actually, the concrete
pathway was the thing which was the hardest to ignore; the eye-level
vegetation was quite similar to certain sections of hiking through the
Coastal Mountains.</p>
<p>There was a small museum-like section about birds, showing egg sizes,
nesting habits, etc. As always, I found the museum extremely boring and
walked through it without slowing (unless forced by gaggles of
children). But the boringness of it was quite nostalgic: it reminded me
of family vacations twenty years ago. Umm, that came out wrong. I mean,
it reminded me of family vacations, when I didn't have to worry about
how to get places, or what to eat, or what I was going to do next on my
job... or how long it'd take until I got home. I mean, vacations were at
most two weeks long, so I always knew that I'd get home soon.</p>
<p>Yeah, I kind-of miss being nine years old. I had this <em>awesome</em> 8088
computer with an amber monitor. Mao, those monichrome amber screens were
fantastic.</p>
<p>Huh. Now I need to figure out how to set my current computer to amber
only. My friends will be <em>so</em> jealous if I can show them that when I get
back to Canada.</p>

</div>
<p>Sentosa Island: this is an "amusement park" island, very close to the
mainland. Walking over the bridge would take about three minutes, but
there was no sidewalk. Another car-only bridge. :(</p>
<p>As a result, we -- yes, for the first time, I was going out with
lab-mates (plus one person's roommate); we watched the Wolverine movie
(more later) and then went off to Sentosa Island; you can see them in
the photos -- took a train across. If it hadn't been so crowded, it
might have given us a nice view of (part of) the island, but as it was,
I would have rather have walked.</p>
<p>Hmm, I'm drawing a blank at further descriptions. We walked around a
bit, ate, then walked around for a bit more. Saw some monkeys. Saw a
huge statue of a mer-lion. Went home. Well, I went home; I exhausted
from the heat, and was much too tired (and too hungry!) to try more
Asian food. They were interested in a food court in the mall, so I told
them to eat there.</p>

</div>
<p>X-men: two weekends ago, I watched the second movie on TV. Last Sat, I
saw Wolverine. Last Sun, I watched the third movie on TV.</p>
<p>Don't worry, no spoilers for the new movie. Wolverine was... well, it
was an action movie. An action movie with better-than-usual special
effects (as least as far as I'm concerned... I'm much more appreciative
of magic-like mutant powers than big explosions and military stuff).
And, sad to say, worse-than-usual dialogue. And, unlike the other X-men
movies, and (from what I hear) the comic books, no attempt at provoking
thoughts.</p>
<p>This isn't necessarily a bad thing. I mean, as long as you know you're
getting mindless violence, and you're in the mood for mindless violence,
then it's great! And thankfully I'd read a few reviews before going to
the theatre, so I knew what to expect. Also, being a Canadian, I always
had to cheer for Wolverine during the "present-day" movies (apart from
his ridiculous interest in Jean Gray), so it was great to see more of
his backstory.</p>
