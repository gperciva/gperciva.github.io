<p>Touristing can make you sick. Tomorrow I'm off to the zoo, leaving
Sunday for recovery.</p>
<p>Interpreting it strictly, "touristing" can give you diseases such as
<em>Miliaria rubra</em>. You see, touristing involves going outside a lot --
since just about everything indoors is lame and boring -- which exposes
you to hot, humid weather.</p>
<p>I diagnosed myself with this on Monday. While the rest of the country
was in an Orange Alert over H1N1 and doing manditory temperature
screening of all university staff and requiring students to be screened
before allowing them into exam rooms, I was trying to cover up the
"unsightly red blotches" (as one website put it) on my upper arms and
legs. I found that splashing cold water on it helped, but I couldn't
splash water on my chest and back while at university. After three days
of showering twice a day, the chemical balance of my skin was restored,
so everything was back to normal.</p>
<p>Oh, for the non-condescending people out there -- this disease is more
commonly called "heat rash" or "sweat rash". Not at all contageous, and
only irritatingly itchy. No, I wasn't talking about anything serious
like malaria. :P</p>
<p>And yes, I'm delightfully aware of the irony of my previous paragraph.
:)</p>
<div class="line-block">

</div>
<p>Interpreting it loosely, "touristing" can give you diseases such as
<em>Americanus Shapus</em>. You see, touristing invoolves going to a foreign
country -- since the grass is always greener in the Sahara desert, or
something like that -- which exposes you to foreign food.</p>
<p>I diagnosed myself with this on Monday. While I was sorting through the
pictures from Sentosa island, I found myself deleting pictures because
they made me look fat. Then I realized that I <em>was</em> fat. Apparently
eating a lot of hamburgers -- both at Burger King, and at food courts --
makes you gain weight. What a surprise!</p>
<p>I'm kind-of stuck. If I don't eat enough or get enough sleep, I get
sick. I can't get enough sleep -- my 25-hour schedule clashes horribly
with a steady work week, and there's still enough meetings and whatnot
that I don't feel that I can go back to 25 hours while in Singapore. So
I'm never getting enough sleep. To keep myself healthy, I try to make
sure that I eat enough.</p>
<p>However, most of the food here is Asian. What a surprise! Ok, not a
surprise at all... but it still makes eating problematic. I mean, I have
problems eating in <em>Canada</em>. Scarse wonder that I have problems here!</p>
<p>As a result, I tend to go to a Western food place (Subway, Burger King,
or a pizza place) once a day, to make sure I have at least one real
meal. Yeah, that's pretty bad. But the alternative is worse... I mean,
although my long-term health is degrading, at least I can still do my
work and whatnot. If I tried to survive on non-Western food only, I'd
end up spending days in bed.</p>
<p>Oh, for anybody who hasn't figured it out yet -- <em>Americanus Shapus</em> is
more commonly called "being overweight" or "looking like a pig". No, I
wasn't talking about anything serious... at least, not anything that
can't be cured with a better diet and running 10km three times a week.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>As I did when coming back from Belfast, within 24 hours of the plane
touching down, I'll run 10km. And soon after that, I'll do at least 30km
each week. Don't worry; for the first week or two, I won't push my
speed.</p>
<p>By the end of summer, I want to run a marathon a week (not necessarily
in one go; two 20km runs and one 5km would be fine), and also be able to
run 10km in 40 minutes.</p>
<p>I also need to regain my musical skills, so I'm imagining an hour of
practice at least every other day. Basically, I'll spend one hour a day
on self-improvement, alternating music and running. Oh, but by "music",
I mean "serious practice", not fun stuff like chamber music. The above
will be put aside for one week in July (where I'll be playing music for
8 hours a day or so).</p>

<p>Only 19 days until I return to Vancouver!</p>
