<p>More touristing stuff: the whole research group went to the Botanical
Gardens, which is right next to one of the university's satellite
campuses, and later I went to the zoo. Oh, and I've changed the settings
on the <a class="reference external" href="https://picasaweb.google.com/107782479450604073806/">picture
website</a>, which
now includes photos of KITTIES.</p>
<p>The botanical garden trip began with dinner at the other campus. This
becomes important later, because this campus canteen was quite inferior
to the Arts canteen in the main campus (where we normally eat). It's not
just me, either: everybody at my table was complaining about the food.</p>
<p>After that, we walked around in the botanical gardens for a while. I
hadn't brought a camera, but one of the group members did.</p>
<p>The following weekend (on the 9th), I went to the zoo. That was way
better than the bird park. I also ended up keeping 101 photos. The zoo
contained waterfalls (I like waterfalls) and KITTIES!!~!</p>
<p>I had more to write, but it's been almost a week since then, and I'm
exhausted. Today I gave a 90-minute talk about user interface design,
followed by a football (soccer) game in the rain. And I didn't eat at
lunch because I thought I'd be eating an early dinner (after the talk,
before the game).</p>
<p>I ended up eating dinner at 8pm, and as a special treat, I went to pizza
hut. This was only the third time I've been there in Singapore, since
it's kind-of out of the way. And more expensive than other food places.</p>
<p>Oh, that is one amusing tidbit about the zoo: on the way there, I was
telling myself that I really needed to take care when being outside in
the sun for this long. I would drink lots of water (even when not
thirsty), eat ice cream or whatever I felt like eating, etc. Regardless
of the cost; I've saved plenty of money from my first few months here.</p>
<p>Sadly, when I really wanted ice cream, there was no washroom around to
clean my hands. On the way out, I considered stopping for pizza, but the
pizzarea was selling slices for over S$ 7 each! I mean, things I'd
normally pay $1.50 for in Canada. I shuddered and walked by. Then, in
the shopping mall where I transferred from bus to MRT, the pizza hut was
full! So I ended up going all the way home and getting a S$2 chicken
burger at the local food court.</p>
<p>Yeah, I fail at spending money. I need more practice or something.</p>
<p>I'll probably go to the Science Centre this weekend -- I'm quite tired,
and apparently this place is within walking distance. Well, a 30-minute
walking distance. I may take the MRT there. And more importantly, it's
indoors.</p>

<p>Only 13 days until I return to Vancouver!</p>
