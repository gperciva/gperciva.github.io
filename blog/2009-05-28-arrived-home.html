<p>I'm back in Vancouver!</p>
<p>Due to the creative time-keeping imposed by tradition (time zones are
stupid; we should just do everything with GMT), this blog post is
approximately 24 hours after the last one, despite the actual local time
reported on each blog post being only being 12 hours apart.</p>
<p>Singapore Changi airport definitely <em>is</em> a nice airport, but I must
admit that the novel was starting to wear thin after 12 hours. I was
really glad to finally board the ANA flight to Narita.</p>
<p>That flight had the individual seat-mounted movie/video/music/game
screens. No power on the seats, though, which made it considerably less
comfortable than the flight from Vancouver to Hong Kong. I managed to
spend about S$35 on souveniers and S$100 on food+drinks (including
buying dinner and drinks for the two group members who came all the way
out the airport to visit me, and in one case carry my luggage. Thanks
again, guys!)</p>
<p>Narita airport was... ok. Not as bad as Heathrow, but nowhere as nice as
Changi. After waffling for a bit, I decided to switch my remaining
Singapore cash into yen. I didn't know if I'd actually find something to
use it on, but I was in a rare spending mode, and I figured that S$64
wouldn't get me far in other countries anyway. After changing all that
cash at the first place I saw, I had 3884 yen. What can you do with
that? In particular, what can you do with that inside the controlled
area of the Narita airport?</p>
<p>First, I went to a bookstore, and picked up volume 26 of Mahou Sensei
Negima. Yeah, that's no way I'll be able to read it (there's lots of
kanji), but... it's Negima! I had to buy it! ... ok, at least one of you
will understand that, and that's more than enough approval for me.</p>
<p>I also picked up a simple manga that had the hiragana and katana written
beside the kanji. And, for that matter, there weren't many kanji to
begin with. On later inspection, I think it's really aimed at young
girls... but I was getting it for reading practice, not to evaluate it
for a literary award.</p>
<p>No, I don't know what the actual title is, since it's written in very
stylized characters. It's by peach-pitt, which is a team that's turned
out some quite nice work in the past.</p>
<p>Then I stopped at the last store before my gate and looked for things to
waste money on. Eventually my eye came to rest on the display of cell
phone strap decorations. I don't even have a cell phone, and everybody
that I know which has cell phones don't attach decorations to them...
but these seem to be really popular in Japan, and most of them were just
so gaudy that I figured that I had to get a few.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I didn't really think about how many I was getting... and
I didn't really think about what "380 - 400 yen" meant (i.e.
approximately $4). So I ended up buying something like $20-worth of
silly, gaudy, impractical cell phone straps.</p>
<p>Oh well. It's not like 2150 yen would do me much good in Canada, either.
After that, I only had coins left, so I bought a bad muffin and some
mango juice. I ended up bringing 134 yen home.</p>

<p>The flight home turned out to be in a refurbished A330-300, so I had
power for my laptop! And individual video screens, although the movies
being offered this time weren't very good. Apart from "Bolt", which was
a great animated movie about a dog actor that thinks that his super-dog
powers are real.</p>
<p>The flight wasn't perfect; there was a crying baby right next to me...
but it was still a good trip. In addition, I was at the very front of
the economy-class cabins. So I got food and drink first, I could leave
first (other than the business-class people), and I had a bit more
legroom than normal economy-class seats.</p>
<p>Canadian immigrations wasn't bad -- it was much, much better than when I
returned from Belfast in late Aug. That was the same time as all the
international students were arriving in Vancouver, and it was on a
weekend, so it took about 90 minutes to get through immigration. This
time it was only foo minutes.</p>
<p>My cat was very happy to see me, and I'm uploading this blog post while
laying on the floor of my living room -- if I went anywhere else, my cat
would complain.</p>
