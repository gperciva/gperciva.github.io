<p>It's finally here -- my United Kingdoms passport arrived. I'm all set
for Glasgow!</p>
<p>I just realized that I haven't mentioned it here yet: I received a big
scholarship to support me as a PhD candidate in the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gla.ac.uk/departments/electronicsandelectricalengineering/">department of
Electronics and Electrical
Engineering</a>
at the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gla.ac.uk/">University of Glasgow</a>.</p>
<p>I'm leaving Vancouver on the 9th of the 9th of the 9th. Quite fitting,
since one of my secret shames is a fondness for numerology, with 9 (and,
to a lesser extent, 3) as my favorite number.</p>
<p>I'll be living at the university's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gla.ac.uk/services/residentialservices/postgraduatelateryear/self-cateredaccommodation/maclayresidences/">Maclay
residence</a>,
shown on <a class="reference external" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=9+Cooperage+Place+glasgow&amp;sll=1.296322,103.77473&amp;sspn=0.017934,0.035963&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=55.868039,-4.290504&amp;spn=0.017049,0.035963&amp;z=14">google
maps</a>.
It claims to be a 15-25 minute walk (I see different numbers quoted in
various places). That's definitely doable on a daily basis, which is
quite nice -- no busses or transit to deal with. Also, I may well buy a
bike when I get there, which would translate into a 5-10 minute bike
ride.</p>
<p>In signing up for my accommodation (online), I was prompted to choose a
password:</p>
<blockquote>
Your Password must be at least 6 characters long and include at
least one number. Choose one you will remember such as your mother's
maiden name, memorable date, favourite football team or pet's name.</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, most people's mother's maiden names contain at least one number. I
must admit that "memorable date" would contain a number, as does the
local football team -- the Vancouver 86ers.</p>
<p>I'm very glad to be acknowledged as a British citizen. This means I
don't need a student visa, I can easily visit anywhere in the EU, and I
can vote for the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.piratpartiet.se/international/english">Pirate
Party</a> in the next
European Parliament elections. Longer-term, this means I can live and
work anywhere in Europe. That's particularly good for an academic, since
there's generally only 5-10 job openings (worldwide!) in your field each
year. It's sad, but if you want to be an academic, there's a very good
chance that you won't be able to stay in your home country. At least,
not without damaging your career.</p>
<p>But now I have two home countries -- Canada and the UK. And this is the
biggest reason I wanted to have the UK passport. I want Glasgow to feel
like me home. I'll be living there for the next 3-4 years, after all! I
think that one of the reasons I never felt at home in Singapore was that
I never really <em>tried</em> to make it feel like a home -- I knew that I'd be
returning to Canada in X months, Y weeks, and Z days.</p>
<p>(no, I didn't keep track of the Z days. It wasn't <em>that</em> bad. I did,
however, keep track of the months and weeks)</p>
<p>Anyway, the whole thing feels much more real to me now. Only a few weeks
of Canadian living left!</p>
