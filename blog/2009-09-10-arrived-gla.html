<p>I've arrived safely at Glasgow.</p>
<p>Check-in and security were uneventful. Flight included LCD displays, but
no power sockets for laptops. I watched a lot of TV shows. No problems
at the border, picking up luggage, or the taxi ride here.</p>
<p>I just discovered that my power converter only works for 2 sockets. My
laptop plug has 3 sockets. What a monumental mistake! I could have
<em>easily</em> spotted this at home, but I didn't bother to check, since my
previous netbook had a 2-prong power socket.</p>
<p>I also discovered that I forgot to bring a keyring. Oh well; those
aren't hard to find.</p>
<p>I'm keeping this message brief because I don't want to run out of power.
I'm sure that it won't be hard to find an electronics shop that has a
converter, but this <em>isn't</em> the kind of thing I wanted to be doing as
soon as I arrived. :(</p>
<p>PS: email isn't working, so if somebody sees this message and knows
people that desperately want to know that I've arrived safely, please
send an email on my behalf.</p>
