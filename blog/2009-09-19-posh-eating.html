<p>While I was putting away utensils and dishes this morning, I discovered
an odd implement in my drawer. It was approximately the size of a spoon,
but it had four long pointy things at the end. Yes, it took me a whole
second to recognize a fork.</p>
<p>Sandwiches are really common in the UK. I mean, really, <em>really</em> common.
I remember one person from Singapore asking me if I really ate bread for
every meal [in Canada], and I replied that I generally had it for lunch,
but ate potatoes or rice for dinner. Over here? Nothing but bread. And,
if one stretches the definition of "sandwich" slightly to include
burgers... actually, I can't think of a sensible definition of
"sandwich" which <em>doesn't</em> include hamburgers... then I can lay claim to
eating nothing but sandwiches for a whole week!</p>
<p>For the past number of days, I've had sliced cheese (it was on sale)
between two slices of white bread (also on sale), microwaved for a
minute. When I go for lunch, my professor always gets a sandwich. When
I'm alone, so far I've gone to Subway because I don't like going to
unfamiliar eateries by myself. I never know whether to order and wait
for the food, order and sit down, or just sit down! And the one time
when I went with a labmate, I wanted a burger anyway.</p>
<p>I started expanding my diet last night, though. Tesco's was selling
pizza at half price, so of course I bought a few. It took me ten minutes
to figure out how to turn on the oven -- and even now I'm not completely
certain how it's done -- but I had a wonderful dinner for £1.74.
(not counting the fraction of a bottle of diet coke)</p>
<p>But that still didn't re-aquaint myself with a fork. So for lunch, I
tried the "cheesey [sic] pasta". It's still made by Kraft, but it comes
in a red box. The pasta is thinner and slightly longer than regular
macaroni, and there's less of it. That's not a bad thing; there's too
much in a normal packet for one person. The cheese mixture is much
sharper, and lumps together much more than the North American variant.
Next time, I might try adding a bit of butter and/or milk.</p>

<p>All in all, I seem to have adjusted well. I have a bank account, I've
done clothes washing twice, and I'm now waking up at 6am. My first full
week wasn't as productive as I had hoped; I was working on some lilypond
stuff but didn't get it finished. Oh well; such is life.</p>
<p>There's only three remaining chores: getting a keycard for the building
(since there's terrawatt lasers and deadly gasses and whatnot, I need to
have a safety lecture), officially registering as a student (my assigned
day is the 24th), and getting a cell phone. I mean, a mobile phone. I'm
quite reluctant to do the latter, but then again, I suppose that they
can't be any worse than Canadian mobile phone companies.</p>
<p>I used to have "buy a keyring" on my list, since I forgot to bring one
from home. But I don't have a clue where to buy them -- at home, we just
seem to accumilate them. However, when I was just about to throw a
twist-tie away, I realized that I could use this as an improvised
keyring. What an engineer I am!</p>

<p>PS: since Tesco's was having a "meal deal" -- £2 for a sandwich,
drink, and chips -- I'll be eating a mostly-fresh sandwich for dinner.</p>
