<p>(alternate title: Why I really need a girlfriend)</p>
<p>I finally have a cell phone -- but no SIM card. I finally found a third
place to have lunch -- after two and a half weeks. And I'm still no
closer to finding a pair of slippers.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, I went walking along Byers street looking for a cell
phone. As I passed each store, I glanced in to see how many salespeople
and customers there were. If there were more salespeople than customers,
I kept on walking. I don't like sales people.</p>
<p>Eventually I found a relatively big store with -- it seemed -- an
acceptably low ratio of staff to customers. Unfortunately, it turned out
that one of them <em>was</em> free, and he began talking to me as I was looking
at the display of "pay as you go" cell phones. I stated that I wanted a
cheap phone with minimal camera capabilities, so he pointed at the
cheapest one with a camera. I started looking at the difference between
that one and other slightly more expensive ones, but he just stood
there, so I got flustered and took the cheapest one. It was only £25, so
I figured it couldn't be too bad a buy. I also got £10 of airtime.</p>
<p>Upon later examination, I found that this provider was more expensive
than others (&amp;pound0.25/minute for local calls, compared to
&amp;pound0.10/minute for another one!). And I also I discovered that the
phone didn't come with a SIM card. Huh.</p>
<p>The SIM card thing was annoying, but the provider was offering a free
SIM card online, so I ordered that. And to be fair, I suppose the same
thing <em>could</em> happen in other domains -- somebody could buy an
ultra-cheap violin without getting a bow, or buying a cheap desktop
computer without a monitor. So I don't blame anything but my own
ignorance for the lack of a SIM card.</p>
<p>The poor deal for the provider was also a matter of ignorance, but a
less acceptible form -- I'd already been looking at cell phones from two
famous providers in the UK. I should have gone with one of them and
ordered the whole thing online.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>As previously mentioned, the cell phone has a camera. When I first used
it, I was amazed at the poor quality. Then I realized that 1) I was
viewing a 640x480 (I think) picture on a 200x135 (or something like
that) screen, and 2) there was a bit of protective plastic wrap over the
camera. I'd taken the plastic wrap off the main display, but missed that
tiny bit on the back of the phone.</p>
<p>(as a completely uninteresting side-note, my ipod nano (won from a
opinion survey submission to UVic) still has the plastic wrap on the
cover. I've had it for 3 years now!)</p>
<p>Now, the phone has bluetooth -- but neither my netbook nor my desktop
has bluetooth. One can theoretically get a USB cable for the phone, but
one end is a propriatary connector, and various discussions online state
that nobody (including official stores!) has such a connector.</p>
<p>So I ended up buying a micro-SD card. It's a bit annoying to transfer
photos, since I need to take the entire back of the cell phone off to
get at the card, but it works. And I won't need to do that change often
-- I wanted to get a 128 or 256-meg card, but the smallest one offered
by the next store I went to was 1 gig. That'll hold thousands of
VGA-resolution photos! Especially since it seems that even the "High
quality" pictures on this phone use jpeg compression.</p>
<p>Pictures of my room, university, and surrounding area <em>will</em> be coming,
but I'll spend a few days taking everything I can think of, then do a
mass upload.</p>

<p>As for lunch... as previously noted, I hate going to a new eating
establishment. Oh, I definitely dislike shopping in general, but
interacting with food places merits a whole new level of feeling. It's
ok if I'm with another person, since I can let them go first (in all
things -- even just walking through the door. People probably think I'm
being polite, but it's really that I want whatever dangers are in the
restaurant to focus on <em>them</em>, while I get adjusted to the new
environment).</p>
<p>As a result, until yesterday there were precisely two places I could
have lunch: a small custom-made sandwich place (which my supervisor
frequents), and Subway. The joy of franchises is that you know what to
expect, no matter which country you're in.</p>
<p>Anyway, I noticed a small "mom and pop"-style place selling kebabs,
pizzas, burgers, etc. We went to one at the ICMC conference, and I've
seen a fair number of them around Glasgow. The middle eastern accent was
slightly difficult to hear, but in an odd way, it was comforting to have
difficulty with a non-English accent -- yes, some Glaswegians are hard
to understand, but they have more of a claim to be speaking "proper
English" than I do. So I had some much-needed meat (a burger) for lunch,
and added a third place to my lunch options.</p>
<p>It's a shame that the "lab culture" here doesn't include having lunch
together; I'm sure that there's loads of other (better?) places to eat
within walking distance of our building.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>As for slippers... in the morning, I went to a few clothes shops to look
for shoes. They <em>did</em> have some... but only a dozen or so. These stores
are <em>tiny</em>!</p>
<p>Based on my misadventures with shopping, I think I'll order them online,
rather than continuing to walk around hoping to stumble upon a decent
shoe store. Or maybe I shouldn't be looking in shoe stores at all... I
must admit that in Canada, I'd check in the Bay or Zellers instead of
going to a shoe store. Of course, at a mall, going to various stores is
much, much easier. I never thought that I'd say this, but I miss malls.
:(</p>
<p>So... can anybody recommend a place to buy slippers online? What do I
want, you ask? Well, think about a sleeping cat curled up in the winter.
Now imagine sticking your feet into the cat.</p>
<p>Yes, I want cat caracass slippers. I want to have a shower at night, put
on my pygamas, shove my bare feet into something furry, and sit at my
computer for a few hours without getting cold. Note that my room
temperature is about 15C, because the heat still isn't working.
(although we have hot water again!)</p>
<p>In honor of the name of the blog, I'll give bonus points for suggestions
of stores which include bunny slippers.</p>
