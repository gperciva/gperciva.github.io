<p>So it turned out that my phone <em>did</em> come with a SIM card -- it was just
that the UI was so terrible, I couldn't get it to work. It makes for an
interesting examination, though. I'm probably one of the last people in
the world who is interested in documentation and HCI (human-computer
interfaces), but who isn't familiar with cell phones. (yes, I had a cell
phone in Singapore, but it was a Windows ME machine on loan -- I had no
particular desire to explore it)</p>
<p>The main difficulty was dialing. I read that I could "dial <tt class="docutils literal">*#100#</tt> to
see [my] phone number". So I pressed those buttons. As soon as I pressed
anything, the screen changed to display the characters I pressed, along
with a "save / delete" prompt at the bottom. But when I finished typing
in the secret code, nothing happened.</p>
<p>Saving the number didn't help. Deleting characters obviously didn't
help. So what the mao?! I also spent ages going through all the menus,
paying particular attention to the Settings and Contacts menus, to see
if the phone knew its number already. Nothing. So I assumed that it
wasn't dialing anything because it didn't have a sim card.</p>
<p>Well, the (extra) sim card arrived, got inserted, and nothing changed.
So I started pressing buttons at random, and when I pressed a green
crescent pointing downwards, it suddenly dialed the number! Quite why a
green downwards crescent is "dial", I don't know.</p>
<p>I'm particularly impressed because <em>nowhere</em> do they explain this. The
three "start here", "beginner's guide" and "complete manual" have lots
of details (and pictures) for adding a sim card, micro-sd card, etc. And
lots of details about how to download new games and stuff like that. But
actually explaining the secret button that dials? Nope.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>Another "joy" is the top-right button. On most screens, this serves as
the "back/cancel" button. When entering digits, it's the "delete"
button. But on the main screen, it's the "launch web browser" button.</p>
<p>So if you're deep in some menu... say, apps-&gt;camera-&gt;take picture-&gt;save
picture, or apps-&gt;organizer-&gt;alarm-&gt;turn on... you keep on pressing that
button to go to a higher-level menu. But if you press it too many times,
it launches the web browser! Of course, you can just press that button
again to quit the browser. But launching the browser takes a second.
It's highly annoying.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>I'm amused that the camera requires a sound -- you can't configure the
phone to take a photo silently. I remember hearing rumors about this
being legislated for phones in Japan due to voyeur panty-shots on the
subway; evidently such concerns affect the UK as well.</p>
<p>As an aside, I <em>really</em> can't fathom the appeal of such photos... I
mean, I'm not personally attracted to nurses or stewardesses, but I can
imagine how somebody might find them really hot. But blurry camera
photos of non-sexy underwear? What's the point?! I mean, a department
store catalog has better photos of underwear!</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>Overall, though, I'm fairly happy with it. As alluded to earlier, the
phone has an alarm. I'm sure that you all just thought "... umm, yeah?",
but I wasn't expecting that. I was willing to pay Â£15 or so for an
alarm, so getting this phone saved me that amount.</p>
<p>I haven't yet used the phone as a phone. One of my labmates asked me to
phone him so he could save my number, but I was concentrating on a
computer problem at the time, so I handed the phone to him and told him
to do it. I guess I should do the same with other people in the lab --
although next time I should actually operate the phone myself.</p>
<p>I kind-of feel like those people who got a computer for the first time,
and are too scared of the machine to try anything themselves. But rather
than getting over it, I'm trying to maintain this feeling -- when you
write documentation or design interfaces, it's good to be as much of a
newbie as possible. I'm decent at pretending to forget all my technical
knowledge, but I've never pretended to be <em>scared</em> of the technology
before.</p>
