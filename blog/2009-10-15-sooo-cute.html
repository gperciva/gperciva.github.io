<p>I finally taught (demonstrated) a lab for the first time. Yay! These
first-year students are <em>soooo</em> cute! We were doing basic logic gates,
working up to a full adder. Their confusion over DeMorgan's law was
priceless!</p>
<p>For those who haven't done boolean algebra (which means that you haven't
done engineering, philosophy, computer science, math, or statistics),
this law states that:</p>
<blockquote>
not( X and Y ) = (not(X)) or (not(Y))
not( X or Y ) = (not(X)) and ((not(y))</blockquote>
<p>They're occasionally useful in proofs (although the proofs that you get
in second-year philosophy courses tend to be fairly contrived examples),
but absolutely vital in electrical engineering. You see, if you have a
chip with 3 OR gates and 3 AND gates, and you need 4 OR gates...
deMorgan's to the rescue!</p>
<p>I especially loved one kid's reaction to me showing him how to
double-negate a term to make it more obviously succeptible to
deMorgan's. "You can do that?!" heh, yep.</p>
<p>(the term in question: (not(A) and (B)). Make that not(not(not(A) and
(B), and it's easier to see that you can use the first of those laws.
Oh, and if you write not(A) as "A with a bar on top" on paper, it's also
easier to see)</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>In the students' defense, deMorgan's is the kind of thing that only my
brother would understand in a lecture. I mean, until you do a few
examples by yourself... ideally under pressure of "I don't have enough
logic gates!"... these laws seem stupid and pointless.</p>
<p>I was chatting with the instructor after the lab, and he said that the
double-negation (i.e. X = not not X; feel free to add not-nots whenever
you want) is one of those mathematical tricks that are really annoying
the first time you see them. Judging from the pleasure I received from
pointing out this trick during the lab... and from my own twisted
personality... I definitely agree with this!</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>On a more serious note, I was struck by how much (most of) the students
enjoyed the lab. They were really proud about building a half-adder
(that's something which adds two single-bit binary inputs, without even
a "carry" input). Many groups were anxious about moving on to the next
question (building a full adder), because they didn't want to dismantle
their half-adder. (even though it stated on the lab sheet that they
should use their half-adder in the full-adder!)</p>
<p>I even wondered how my life would have gone differently if I had signed
up for the first-year computer architecture lab at SFU... I avoided
doing any labs, because they seemed like a lot of work and I was
insanely lazy in those days (hey, I was doing Philosophy!). But if I'd
taken a lab or two, would I have gotten "bitten" by the "building
things" bug? Would I have switched over to doing electrical engineering
as my first degree?</p>
<p>This isn't really a regret -- my life progressed the way it did. If I
were into regrets over my academic career, I'd be bitterly cursing the
SFU computer science regulations at the time and the dot-com boom. Due
to the dot-com boom, there were <em>tons</em> of CS students, so upper-level
courses were restricted to declared majors. But to do the department
regulations, you could only become a declared major if you took PHIL 001
"critical thinking". Since I was doing a philosophy honors degree and
that course was so easy it didn't count towards a major (let alone an
honors!), I refused to take the course, and as a result I ended up doing
discrete mathematics.</p>
<p>Now, I don't dislike discrete mathematics. But I feel much more at home
approaching it from a CS perspective. I like to be motivated by the
thought of writing a program to create sudoku squares or discover music
phrases; studying combinatorics or cliques in graph theory just for the
sake of aesthetics doesn't get me particularly enthused.</p>
<p>I guess I <em>have</em> been bitten by the "build things" bug.</p>
