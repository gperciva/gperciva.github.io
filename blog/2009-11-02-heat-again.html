<p>You may recall me being very happy that our heater was fixed on 14 Oct.
Well, less than a week later, it broke again. Today it was fixed again.
Hope this lasts!</p>
<p>Having no heat really saps one's energy. I spent a few minutes trying to
figure out why it's so bad here -- I'm used to living in basements, and
I rarely turn on electric heaters, so I'm used to being in 16-18 C
rooms. But in those places, I could easily sit up in bed. There was
something behind me, with extra open space for my head. Over here, the
bed is right next to the wall, so when I try to sit up, I have to be 90
degrees up, rather than leaning back.</p>
<p>Yes Mom, I'm going to look for those pillow/cushions that are designed
for sitting up in bed. Not that I <em>need</em> one now, but I used to do a lot
of programming in bed. So I guess I could consider it a "business
expense". :)</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>I get a lot of questions about playing music. No, I don't have an
instrument yet. Once my first rhythm evaluation web survey is up
(hopefully within days), I'll ask my supervisor about that cello of his,
and/or take home one of the £50 violins in the lab, and/or figure out if
my residence has any policy on practicing instruments in the rooms.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>In other news, I'm almost finished the £500 I brought with me... it
should last until the end of the week. Since that includes various
one-time expenses of setting up my life here, I'm not freaking out about
spending £250 a month for living expenses.</p>
<p>Still, CDN$500 / month sounds like a lot. I'm trying not to think about
it.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>

<p>Other than that... we had a bit of rain over the weekend. There seems to
be more Halloween parties here, although that's almost certainly just
because I'm living in a student residence instead of a nice quiet house.
I didn't see many trick-or-treaters, but then again, I spent Sat night
in the lab (it has a heater!), and I didn't expect to see many in the
locked building. :)</p>
<p>I continue to eat at Subway almost once a day -- I think I ate there for
19 of the past 21 days. On one hand, I feel as though I should consider
this lame... but on the other hand, their "sub of the day" is only
£1.99, and they're quite healthy. Definitely healthy when compared to
the other stuff I eat! I'm really not seeing any downside to this.</p>
