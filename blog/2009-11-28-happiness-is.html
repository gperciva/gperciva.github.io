<p>Happiness is sitting in your university lab at 3:30am on Saturday
morning, with a cup of lukewarm tea made with two-day old milk that's
been sitting on a ledge outside the window because the fridge isn't
working, eating nothing but Mars bars for the past four hours because
nothing is open in the city, with half the lights turned off because
they flicker unbearably, finally alone after all the labmates had left,
and having implemented the Friedman test in python to check your
experimental data.</p>
<p>Actually, I'm not totally alone. There's still the Chinese postgrad in
the next lab. But that's far enough away that I consider myself alone.</p>
<p>I'm happy.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>The experimental data is looking quite good -- the planned "best case"
resulted in a p value of 0.00025. For those of you who remember as much
about statistics as I did three hours ago, this means "it's really
really really unlikely that the difference is due to random chance".
Which translates into "you're doing the right thing".</p>
<p>Another set of exercises resulted in a low p value but unexpected
results, which is exciting. The last two sets of exercises produced
unclear results... but that's the whole point of a preliminary survey.
As far as preliminary surveys go, I couldn't ask for anything better!</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>Residence heat: since the last report, we've lost heat twice and had it
repaired twice. We've had heat for the last 8 days, which is the longest
we've ever had it. Hopefully it'll last this time!</p>
<p>Speaking of heat, it's been disappointly warm outside. Ok, by "warm", I
mean "5-10C", which doesn't strike most people as warm... but I was
hoping for snow. Talking to my labmates, it doesn't sound like Glasgow
gets much snow. :(</p>
<p>Glasgow seems to have the same Fall weather as Vancouver, which makes me
quite at ease. Overcast, mixed rain and drizzle... that's the right kind
of weather! I think it's a bit windier here than in Vancouver, although
I might be mistaken since my bike path in Victoria didn't expose me to
much wind. The rain here is no problem at all, but the drainage is quite
poor: the sidewalk gains a few huge puddles -- at times, I walk along
the road to avoid the sidewalk-puddles! At other times, I scrunch up
against the fence away from the road, since the road has huge puddles
which turn into fountains when cars drive through them.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>On one such stormy and dark night, filled with chest-high
puddle-car-splooshes, I trotted off to the university chapel to turn
pages for a clarinet trio. For the non-classical musicians out there,
this means "clarinet, cello, and piano". I did a good job on my first
page-turning experience... I had to hold the page a few times as the
fans threatened to turn the page at the wrong time, and the pianist
thanked me for that extra duty.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>I've finished demonstrating for the first-year analog+digital
electronics class; the last two weeks were making a radio and making
some "christmas lights" (just a series of LEDs flashing in a particular
order). Next term, I'm teaching the first-year "introduction to C
programming" course with my supervisor. I'm really looking forward to
this -- especially since everybody (labmates, other postgrads, even
faculty!) warns me about how terrible it will be. Bah! I'm not afraid of
pointers, and I'm <em>definitely</em> not afraid of explaining them.</p>
<p>Next week, half the lab is going off to New Zealand (and maybe
Australia?) for 2 or 3 conferences. With that, as well as the
undergraduate teaching being over, I expect things to get much quieter.
I should really be able to catch up on my research! Oh, by the way, I
went off to a two-day workshop at the Open University at Milton Keynes a
few weeks ago. Not really much to say about that trip, other than I met
three people (one student, two professors) who were interested in my
work and who were doing related stuff.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>So, in the near future, I'll have much more time (and energy) for work.
I'm getting involved in the 19-tone equal temperament pitch tracker for
Rosegarden (we'll do the normal 12-tone as well, since most people would
much rather have that). As previously mentioned, my preliminary survey
of grading rhythmic exercises is done, so in the very near future I can
launch the real survey. And I've already started thinking about the
sheet music analysis + rhythm extraction + automatic exercise generation
project.</p>
<p>My sleep schedule has been quite poor, so I've decided to go back to my
26-hour cycle. That's a major contribution towards my happiness... not
having to worry about going to bed or waking up is a <em>huge</em> relief. I
need to do some teaching on Monday and Tuesday next week (filling in for
one of the people going to New Zealand), but after that my schedule will
be blissfully free for self-scheduled work.</p>
