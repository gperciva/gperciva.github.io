<p>We still have ice here from the snow a few weeks -- and not just a thin
layer of black ice; this is ice compacted from a few centimeters of
snow. Even worse, the temperature has been slightly above freezing
during the day. A little bit of ice melts, turns into water and levels
out the surface, then freezes overnight. Very slippery conditions.</p>
<p>I always used to complain that shovelling snow -- if it was a little
bit, like 5cm -- was counter-productive. I mean, most snow is just fine
for walking on. Even if it partially melts + freezes again, you just
have a crunchy layer at the top of the snow, but the rest is pretty
un-slippery. The really dangerous part was the ice that you get on the
almost-bare surfaces.</p>
<p>Now that I've experienced truly well-trodden snow, I have to admit that
my parents were right to make me shovel the sidewalk. In some parts of
my daily commute, there's two centimeters of ice on the sidewalk.
Apparently it's not a legal requirement here to clear the sidewalks...
or maybe that law just isn't enforced. There's one short stretch of
sidewalk which the city put sand on, but the rest is all bare ice. In
any case, I've never seen walking conditions this bad for this long.</p>
<p>I don't think my lack of proper winter boots is a problem, though. If
this ice was more jagged, having proper treads would help, but I haven't
found many pieces of jagged ice due to all the thawing-freezing cycles.
Oh well; I'm getting good practice for my balance and reflexes.</p>
<p>I admit that I fell <em>once</em>, but that was due to the law of universal
comedy. I was leaving the flat of one of the professors after a
Christmas dinner. His wife called out "be careful, it's slippery!". I
half turned to wave and said "oh, I'll be fine" -- with the last word
being affected by a Doppler shift as the sound source suddenly dropped a
meter. Fortunately, the angle of my half-turn protected the chocolates I
was given, and I got my other hand beneath me to cushion the fall.</p>

<p>In related news, it's "that time of the year" again, when I need to take
special measures to control the bleeding. As usual, I left it a bit too
late, but I'm ok now.</p>
<p>... I'm referring to my hands. When it's cold, my skin gets very dry,
cracks, and blood oozes out. Particularly from the knuckles. A few days
ago, I had to be careful when folding my laundry to avoid getting blood
on my clothes.</p>
<p>After a few days of gingerly washing my fingertips (to avoid getting the
back of my hands wet, since that makes the dryness worse when it
evaporates), I finally went of to Boots to get some cream. It worked
amazingly well; I've only put it on twice, and my hands are almost back
to normal. My bedroom now smells like skiing, but oh well. It fits the
season, I guess!</p>
<p>(cream -&gt; smells a bit like sunscreen -&gt; I only use sunscreen when
skiing -&gt; room smells like skiing)</p>

<p>In yet more mundane news, I'm really making myself comfortable in the
lab. I have a desk drawer with a dozen cans of diet coke (it's much
cheaper than buying from the vending machine!), about twenty of those
delicious chocolate-mint-wafer no-name biscuits from Sainsbury's, some
Christmas chocolates, and two pairs of socks (in case my feet get wet on
the way to university). I also brought my dressing gown (it's made from
thick fluff material, like a towel -- this isn't a flimsy girly
negligee!), which I leave on my chair when I'm not wearing it.</p>
<p>I swapped violin cases with the other violin (it only has three strings,
and the bow has a ton of electronics taped onto it; nobody's going to
miss that case!), so now my shoulder rest fits in the violin case. I
found some music stands in a corner of the lab, and took one back to my
desk, where it holds the Bach violin partita no. 2. I'm even working on
the Chaconne!</p>

<p>New Year's Eve was a non-event for me; I woke up at 8pm, and went about
my normal business. While I was writing a reply email to my mother about
the 19 equal-temperament clarinet, I heard some firecrackers outside,
and muttered to myself about young hooligans. When I reached the end of
the reply, I saw that she'd wished me happy new year, and I realized
that the firecrackers had been set off at midnight.</p>

<p>I'm now seriously working on setting up my software on windows. As I've
said a few times in the past, I used cross-platform libraries, so in
theory it should be easy to get it working on windows... but it's
proving extremely difficult to install software on windows.</p>
<p>I've installed cygwin, but that doesn't have all the libraries I need. I
installed python, but that requires manually adding
/cygdrive/c/Python/include to CFLAGS and ../lib to LDFLAGS. I have
windows git installed, but the command-line that this gives me is
different from the command-line that cygwin gives me, which is also
different from the command-line that windows comes with. Copying to and
from the cygwin windows is a completely byzantine process. Libraries
like libsndfile get installed to Program Files/Mega-Nerd/libsndfile,
which requires yet more manual CFLAGS and LDFLAGS.</p>
<p>Ye flipping mao, hasn't anybody heard of a shared location for include
files and libraries?! How on earth do people get anything done on
windows?! I've spent ten hours, and will probably spend at least another
ten, trying to replicate what, on my linux machine, would be a one-line
command:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
aptitude install libsndfile-dev libsamplerate-dev libaubio-dev libfftw3-dev qt4-dev-tools python-dev
</pre>
<p>And if you think the above command is confusing, that's just because I'm
posting it as text -- I use a graphical tool to look at all the
available programs, click on the ones I want, and then click an
"install" button. The operating system then downloads the programs,
installs them, configures them, and I'm good to go. It takes
approximately 10 mouse clicks and maybe 15 minutes (mainly spent
downloading). I can write emails or have tea while it's taking the 15
minutes, though.</p>
