<p>I just had (an hour of) the most amazingly good journey of my life,
taking the train from Glasgow to Birmingham. I took notes as I went, and
filled them in later. Later edit: ok, only the first 90 minutes were
great. The rest was just normal train stuff.</p>
<p>It snowed about 2cm the night before -- not enough to make anything
difficult, but enough to make everything look beautiful. It also
improved the footing; walking on snow is much, much easier than walking
on ice. The snow <em>did</em> cause some transportation problems. Other trains
(even on the same route!) were delayed and even cancelled. So when I
left home for the 45 minute walk to the station, I didn't know if I'd be
going or not.</p>
<p>I didn't care, though, because it was a fantastic walk. The trees looked
great with the snow, the riverside walk was quiet and away from traffic,
there was fresh snow on the trees, crunching the fresh powder underfoot
was fun, and did I mention the pretty snow-covered trees?</p>
<p>The train station was above the ground floor, which surprised me. It was
quite open and well-organized, though. Part of me wants to say
"Victorian", but only because I associate trains with that era.
Definitely picturesque. It also had more coffee shops per capita than
downtown Vancouver. There were a few police offers around, but it
defintely felt like a transportation place rather than a prison /
secrity-place (i.e. an airport).</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>The train left 11 mintues late; no big deal. My coach (1 of 3 normal
coaches; there was a separate first-class coach) was about 30% full? It
was way less than I expected, especially given the earlier
cancellations. Everybody in my side of the coach had a pair of seats to
themselves... there were two seats on either side of the aisle. I
couldn't see if it was more packed in the other coaches, but I doubt it.</p>
<p>The train itself was smooth, not significantly noisy, had bigger seats
than an airplane, way bigger washrooms, power sockets for all pairs of
seats, and OMG why do people put up with planes for travel inside a
country? I mean, seriously. You're not treated like a criminal before
you get to the vehicle, you can just walk up to it without arriving
hours early to wait in a series of lineups... it's a totally different
way to travel.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>Scenery: omg omg omg. The 2cm of snow was the most significant
precipitation we've had in 2 or 3 weeks, but MAO was it well-timed. Snow
on trees? Fields of smooth, untouched powder?!?! There's something about
untouched powder that makes me go "rowr". Also, small creeks meandering
through white fields. Mao, now I want to go skiing.</p>
<p>Hills: looking gorgeous. I want to go hiking. I'm aware of safety,
though, so I'm not over-keen to go by myself. Maybe when somebody from
Vancouver comes to visit, we could go north for a bit and find some
hiking trails?</p>
<p>Trees: the sudden treelines would normally look ridiculous, but in the
snowy landscape they somehow work. Maybe because everything looks
toylike, so a computer-game-type "block of field, block of trees, block
of field" fits with the toy theme?</p>
<p>Pictures: given my experience with previous cell phone pictures, I'm not
keen to try more. Also, the windows seem to reflect inside light, so the
pictures would probably be even worse than they would otherwise be.</p>
<p>I saw some sheep... I think they were sheep. Various livestock, at
least.</p>
<p>We went through a patch of thick fog rising from a snowy field,
obscuring distant hills or forest or roads -- I could only see unbroken
snow powder merging with fog/cloud/steam a few hundred meters away.
Beautiful. Only lasted about 5 minutes, but wow.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">After an hour, it wasn't as impressive. Less snow, less hills.
Probably in England instead of Scotland. :)</div>
<div class="line">(after a quick check with fellow passengers, we're still in Scotland,
although we're getting close to Carlisle, which is the first stop in
England. We haven't had any stops so far, BTW.</div>
</div>
<p>After an hour and twenty minutes, we arrived in Carlisle and picked up
more passengers. Including somebody with the seat next to me, to my
annoyance. The scenery wasn't as nice, either -- light industrial areas,
warehouses, a few houses, motorways, etc. Flat.</p>
<p>I definitely like Scotland more. (well, to be fair, more than that part
of England)</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>The two hour mark had us in an area with low hills; maybe the lake
district?</p>
<p>We had more and more stops in England, picking up more and more
passengers until we go to Crewe. This part of the journey wasn't amazing
at all; it was almost like a bus ride. We stopped every 15-20 minutes to
pick up or drop off passengers. We arrived in Birmingham 30 minutes
behind schedule, but everything else was behind schedule as well due to
the panic over a centimeter or two of snow. (wusses!)</p>
<p>Brimingham New Street Station was a bit confusing; there were 12
platforms, some of which with an "a" and "b" side. Much worse was that
there were no trains going to Worcester! I mean, not just "I missed my
train and must wait 2 hours", but there just didn't seem to any such
trains!</p>
<p>After wandering around for a bit, I asked a station attendant, who
directed me to another attendant, who told me I wanted the train to...
Hereford, I think? I honestly can't remember the name, and that was only
15 minutes ago. In any case, it was platform 12b, which had a train
leaving in 10 minutes. Either it's a common run, or the earlier train
was delayed, or I just totally lucked out.</p>
<p>It would have been nice if my tickets -- or at least iternary -- had
specified that I wanted the train going to XYZ, rather than simply
telling me the station I wanted to get off at. Grr. Oh well, at least I
know for next time.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>Overall, I'm inspired to leave my lab routine. Travel by train was easy,
not all that expensive if you book a month or two in advance, and
there's some spectacular scenery in Scotland.</p>
<p>Getting out and seeing the city? Bleh. Clubs, shopping, "city" things:
bleh, not interested. Art museums: sorry, but also bleh. Architecture:
ok, not entirely bleh here, but not enough to make me go significantly
out of my way. But nature? Not bleh. The hills look good, although of
course they're nothing compared to the Rockies (a mountain range in
Western canada). I want to go north and see the Highlands.</p>
<p>The above was true of my time in Singapore -- I was never inspired to go
downtown, and in the few times that I did, I didn't find anything
particularly interesting. But I loved looking at the plants (often the
"normal" plants growning at the side of the road -- special plants in a
zoo or whatnot are <em>supposed</em> to be special; I liked the exotic plants
in "normal" places) and animals.</p>

</div>
<p>It took over 2 hours to write this post, because I kept on stopping to
stare at the scenery in Scotland.</p>
