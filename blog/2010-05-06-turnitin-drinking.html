<p>Postgraduates students in the department of Electronics and Electrical
Engineering at the University of Glasgow are forced to submit our yearly
progress reports to the the plagiarism detection website "turn it in".
Leaving aside the questionable copyright and privacy issues involved in
tying academic progression to an independent for-profit company, I was
amused by how badly their "service" worked. I therefore created a
drinking game to celebrate its ineptitude.</p>
<p>Text <strong>IN BOLD CAPITALS</strong> indicates the portions of my report which were
"similar" to other work.</p>

<p>Chug the glass if you've plagiarised...</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>"<strong>WORK IN COMPUTER-ASSISTED COMPOSITION HAS FOCUSED ON EITHER</strong>"...
hey, I just plagiarised a phrase from an international conference
paper... for which I was the primary author!</li>
<li>you're flagged because you've cited the same paper in your report
that you'd previously cited in an international publication for which
you were the primary author. (a different paper than last time)</li>
<li>you've plagiarized a <em>citation</em> to your <em>own</em> international
conference paper from an undergraduate student paper from Bristol
which (presumably) cited you.</li>
</ul>
<hr class="docutils">
<p>All examples are presented in their entirety -- there wasn't more text
connected to the statistics example which I've omitted to make a joke.
It really complained about "mean is blah, standard deviation is blah".</p>
<p>Furthermore, the bibliography "similarity" was a huge portion. The
"similarity index" of my 20-page report was 10%, but when I select the
"exclude bibliograph" option, that dropped to 2%.</p>
<p>This is quite puzzling -- a bibliographic entries <em>should</em> be exactly
the same as other papers. I mean, given text like this:</p>
<blockquote>
G. Percival, Y. Wang, and G. Tzanetakis. "Effective Use of
Multimedia for Computer- Assisted Musical Instrument Tutoring". In
<em>EMME '07: Proceedings of the International Workshop on Educational
Multimedia and Multimedia Education</em>, pages 67â€“76, New York, NY,
USA, 2007. ACM Press.</blockquote>
<p>there's no other way to cite that article! (BTW, this was the citation
that I apparently "plagiarised" from the student in Bristol) I mean, any
deviation from the above would be <em>wrong</em>. Ok, I suppose I could omit
the page numbers, or write the conference name in a slightly different
manner (like omitting the "EMME '07" part)... but get real. The <em>best</em>
papers would cite articles in the same way, probably even using the
shared databases of bibtex entries like
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/">DBLP</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://liinwww.ira.uka.de/bibliography/">the Collection
of Computer Science
Bibliographies</a>, or getting
a bibtex entry directly from the publisher's website). What's more,
their "service" clearly identified my bibliography as such -- so why
complain about the similarity in citations? That just doesn't make
sense.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>I have nothing against computerized grading of student work -- I mean,
that's half my Masters, and will be half my PhD thesis. I'm quite aware
of the pressures on universities and colleges, and the overwhelming
amount of student cheating that goes on. There was an outrageous amount
of plagiarism going on in the course I was teaching, and it really
sucked to give grades to the cheaters (I lacked solid evidence) and see
hard-working (but non-cheating) students only complete two assignments
out of five. And technology definitely <em>can</em> play a role in keeping this
under control.</p>
<p>But that's no excuse for poorly-designed software and idiotic academic
policies. If the software can't handle submissions from people with
international publications, why is it being used on postgraduates at a
major university?! Restrict its use to undergraduates only -- there
might still be some problems with a few senior undergraduates having
published a paper or two, but those would be rare. But PhD students
should be expected to have a few publications before they start, and
will probably have 5-10 by the time they finish. There's only a few ways
to give a short history of "related work" in your area; of course you'll
use some phrases that you used in your previous publications!</p>
<hr class="docutils">
<p>Oh well. It provided a certain amount of amusement, and I don't
anticipate any problems when I meet with the faculty member who
evaluates my technical report and the "similarity report" about it. I
have to say, though, that I'm really wishing I stayed at UVic. This is
just insulting.</p>
