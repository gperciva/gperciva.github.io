<p>On April 30, the department had a "day trip" to the Isle of Bute. I was
wondering whether to go or not, but when I discovered that there was a
Canada Hill on the island I had to go. Pictures included.</p>
<p>Sorry, the pics are from my mobile phone. It's not <em>too</em> terrible for
landscape photos, though.</p>

<p>I was struck by how small it was -- approximately 5000 people. I think
this was the first time I'd spent more than 10 minutes in a town/village
of that size. It was a bit weird; I couldn't imagine living there. I've
said previously that I preferred small towns (mainly comparing Victoria
to Vancouver), but I obviously need to amend that to preferring
"medium-sized cities". Somewhere between 100,000 and 200,000 people,
maybe?</p>
<p>Not really much else to say about the trip. I added funny comments to
most of the photos, so reading those is probably better than reading
more of this text.</p>
