<p>I've written a quick test of key presses and mouse clicks in flash --
does your computer lose any?</p>
<p>We were doing some final (?) testing of my tempo-detection flash game on
my mother's computer, but discovered that the computer was failing to
detect some key presses. After a bit more testing, I decided it was
unlikely that it was a hardware problem. So either my Mom's version of
flash can lose some keypresses, or there's something wrong with my
program.</p>
<p>I made a simple test that just prints out info for each key press or
mouse click. It's mainly so that we can test it on my mother's computer,
but I'm including it here in case anybody else feels like being nice and
wouldn't mind testing it a bit. :)</p>
<p>The object: tap a key a set number of times. Check if the computer has
detected the right number. You could do this by picking a number like 20
and just start tapping... or you could pick a rhythm-saying (like "shave
and a haircut, two bits" -- that's 7 taps) and repeating that a few
times.</p>
<p>If you discover that the computer's count of the taps doesn't match what
you think you did, I'd really like to hear about this. It's possible
that something's just wonky on my mom's computer, and that I don't need
to scrap this whole research project. However, it's also possible that a
typical flash installation doesn't reliably detect key presses. This
would cause great problems for me, of course, but knowing about the
problem would be better than not knowing about it.</p>
<p>If you discover some missing key presses, please try it with the mouse
-- if the mouse is more reliable than the keyboard, I can still go ahead
with this (albeit with a few changes).</p>

<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>PS: I'm not finding any blog or forum posts complaining about the
reliability of key events in flash, so it might be something weird in my
game after all. The real test is to find out if this simple test works
on a computer that couldn't handle the actual game, of course.</p>
<hr class="docutils">
<p><strong>Later edit:</strong> Apparently the keys are reliable when I compile my
project for flash 10 instead of flash 9. Maybe the additional
optimizations in 10 help? Anyway, things seem to be working now.</p>
