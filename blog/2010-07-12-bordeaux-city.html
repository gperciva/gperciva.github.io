<p>Report about my "tourist" time in Bordeaux. I'll be making later posts
about the technical material from my talk and the conference as a whole.
This post is just about tourist information, and is probably only of
interest to my immediate family and friends, who probably all shuddered
when they heard that I was going to Bordeaux, city of fine wines, fine
dining, and hot sunny weather.</p>
<p>Anyway, Bordeaux. I generally took no pictures (to conserve my
power-cable-less mobile phone alarm clock, but when we stumbled upon a
Botanical Gardens, I figured that I really had to take a few -- not that
the plants were <em>particularly</em> interesting, but because I seem to have
developed a habit of posting photo sets from gardens around the world.)</p>

<div class="section" id="friday">
<h2>Friday</h2>
<p>Met with John Mandereau (who I'd met on Thurs) and Valentin Villenave,
whose name is pronounced "Val-en-ton". Not that anybody from the UK can
justifiably complain about spelling vs. pronounciation of names.</p>
<p>We had lunch at the conference caferia: chicken (I didn't take), rice,
brocolli, mixed salad thing, and some raspberry pudding-thing. The mixed
salad thing and raspberry pudding-thing were fancier than I'd expect
from an English university cafeteria; the rice and brocolli were about
the same.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I gave my talk. More details about that later.</p>
<p>After the talk, we went to the casino (<em>un supermaché</em>, remember, not a
den of dubious mathematical ability) for some drinks. That sounds way
classier than "we went to the grocery store to get some bottles of warm
coke, because they were out of cold coke". We then went downtown, and I
saw some of the major sights (and sites) of the city -- the cathedral,
the grand theatre, and the longest pedestrian-only road in France or
Europe or something like that.</p>
<p>Of course, we also did something else. What do three guys in their late
20s / early 30s do when they're on vacation in a foreign city, far away
from anybody who might recognize them...? Yep, that's right -- we went
clothes shopping!</p>
<p>I had previously gone to two Primark stores (seems like the UK version
of Zellars, Walmart, etc) and been unable to find men's shorts without
hawaiian patterns on them. And I didn't look at the weather forcast for
Bordeaux until a day before I left... if I'd realized that it would be
35 C, I'd have made more of a priority for finding shorts, and maybe
even sandals. But I hadn't, so I didn't.</p>
<p>We found a mall and then checked out three different clothing stores,
and I tried on four pairs of shorts, before I found something
semi-decent. They were 25 € , which seemed like a complete rip-off (for
reference, my pants... err, "trousers"... were £6, and my t-shirts were
£2 each, and the exchange rate is less than 1.2 € per £1). But I was too
miserable in my long pants (err, trousers) to quibble.</p>
<p>To complete our de-male-ification, John bought a pair of shoes as well.
So in our first few hours of vacation in Bordeaux, we did everything
girly apart from ogling hot guys. If girls do that? I certainly know
that I was ogling hot girls... and in the entire time I was there, I
only saw 2 or 3 girls under the age of 40 who weren't "hot" by Glasgow
standards. French girls are really, really hot.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>We then went to a pizzeria for dinner. Apparently ham and pineapple is
an "<em>exotique</em>" pizza. The discussion rapidly became an examination of
modern community political parties. Dinner was followed by "a political
film", although we thought it was clumsily done. I don't mind films with
a Message (with a capital 'M'), but only as long as the Message is
delivered well. This one wasn't. It felt like the film was preaching to
the choir, and tried to throw in a few questionable things to make the
whole thing "edgy". Oh, but I discovered that French cinemas have really
comfortable chairs. Padded red velvet things... way better than Canadian
cinemas.</p>
<p>The film was supposed to be followed by a "discussion", but we left as
soon as it was over. We then spent an hour walking around in a circle
(not in the mathematical "an infinite series of points which are
equidistant from one central point", but in an "we returned to the
starting point") looking for a bar. At that point, John declared himself
in charge, and found a bar which was 30 seconds away from our
starting/ending point (which was a tram station).</p>
<p>Oh yeah, the main transport (at least for us) were trams. These travel
at something like 20 km/h... faster than I could run, but nowhere near
the speed of subway trains.</p>

<div class="section" id="saturday">
<h2>Saturday</h2>
<p>Went to "grande public" version of the conference: a few large tents by
the river, filled with booths. Nothing that I hadn't seen at the main
"technical" conference. But there we met up with Nicolas Sceaux, scheme
programmer extrodinaire.</p>
<p>Ate a on a cafe terrace; we all had <em>le plat du jour</em>. The first course
was a seafood pastry; the main course was pork, vegetables, and rice;
the dessert was chocolat mousse; the meal also included some
after-dinner coffee. But this description completely misses the elegance
of the presentation, the style of cooking (no clue), the spices used
(dunno), the types of vegetables (don't even know that), the reason why
the rice was yellow (herbs?), etc. Basically: it was a real French meal
at a real French cafe in a real French trendy district of a real French
city.</p>
<p>I expected to feel completely awkward and out of place, but it was
actually ok.</p>
<p>We were waiting for a friend to finish meeting with his grandparents, so
we went to a bookstore so that I could look at French <em>bande dessinée</em>
(graphic novels) -- I knew that they had a tradition of such things, and
I was curious as to whether there was any simularity to Japanese manga.
(there wasn't)</p>
<p>We then gave up on the friend and tried to drive to the beach, but
encountered some insane traffic jams and turned back. While we were
returning to town, the friend phone up, so we met for pre-dinner drinks
at another outdoor cafe. More politics was discussed.</p>
<p>The evening meal was <em>crépes</em>, which were fantastic. These are thin
pancakes, folded to make a vaguely envelope-shaped thing, with some kind
of filling inside -- ham and cheese, salmon, vegetarian paté, etc. I had
the vegetarian one for the main course, and a caramel <em>crépe</em> for
dessert. It was incredibly good.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sunday">
<h2>Sunday</h2>
<p>We saw John off to the train station, then Valentin and I went to the
botanical gardens. That was followed by boxed sandwiches from a
supermarket, eaten in the park next to the gardens. Academic politics
was discussed.</p>
<p>After lunch, we rented some bikes, which was a fantastic idea. Bordeaux
(and, according to Valentin, most major French cities) have rental bikes
along the side of the road. You use a credit card (or maybe debit card?)
to put down a deposit, then rent the bike for 1 or 2 Euro an hour. We
zoomed along the riverside, then went up to the lake. After we arrived
at the lake beach, I remembered that French beaches were (in)famous for
certain things. We didn't stay long, though, and went back to the city.</p>
<p>Saw some tower/arch thing (famous gate to the city, lookout point, or
something), saw some archeological dig of Christian graves from the 1st
to 7th centuries (fun fact: the French word for "Christianity" is
"Chretien", which is the name of one of the Canadian prime ministers...
every time the tour guide said that word, I thought about politics), saw
a church that was every bit as fancy as a cathedral (albeit not as
large).</p>
<p>We wandered around for an hour looking for a good place for dinner that
wasn't too expensive without finding anything (my friend: "it's
Bordeaux! They don't know about `not expensive'" -- although since he
was from Paris, I'm not certain that he actually knows about living
cheaply). Inspired by a desire to be horrible, we ended up having dinner
at a Subway.</p>
<p>It wasn't great. They didn't have the selection of bread that UK Subways
have, they didn't have as many sauces (although I <em>did</em> discover that
southwest sauce is pretty good on an Italian BMT), and the lettuce
looked a bit suspect (the store was quite warm). However, it <em>did</em>
provide nourishment, and it wasn't expensive. Also, it's certain to
horrify anybody who reads this blog post. :)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="monday">
<h2>Monday</h2>
<p>We went to see a mall, since they were all closed on Sunday. I was
curious about daily life, and I'd already seen the streets and
transport.</p>
<p>It was pretty much the same as malls in Canada, the UK, and Singapore.
Maybe slightly more perfume stores and chocolate/sweet stores than in
the other countries, but I wouldn't immediately say that it was a
statistically significant difference. We went to a large department
store as well... it had much more <em>bande designée</em> than I was expecting,
but other than that it was pretty much like such stores in Canada and
Singapore. (I haven't been to such a store in the UK)</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>Got a city bus to the airport; that was fine. Bordeaux Airport doesn't
have quick check-in machines... at every other airport I've been to, if
you only have hand baggage, you can use a computer to check in and get
your boarding pass. But over here, I had to line up with all the people
putting baggage in the cargo bay. Ick. :(</p>
<p>I did sudoku puzzles for all the flight.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>Back in London Gatwick, I kept on getting thrown by people speaking
English. I mean, I'd gotten used to rehearsing a sentence a few times
and having difficulty understanding what people were saying... but now
suddenly, I speak the native language!</p>
<p>There was yet another switch coming in the departure lounge at Gatwick
airpot -- the serving staff at the restaurant I stopped at (to get a
burger; this wasn't a fancy French restaurant) spoke French between
themselves, so I found myself ordering and asking for the bill in
French. So much for the "back in Britain" bit!</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>I really regret not doing any language preparation... even something as
basic as listening to half a dozen podcasts would have done a lot to
re-tune my mind for the language and remind myself of some vocabulary.
Oh well; next time!</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>And now for the two questions you've all been waiting for. Was I scared
of people thinking that I was an American and wimped out by carring a
Canadian flag around with me? Yes; it took me less than 6 hours. I had a
luggage tag with a big Canadian flag; I removed that from my suitcase
and attached it to my handbag.</p>
<p>And the second question: do I have the most incredible tan lines that
I've ever had in my life? Yes. The difference between my lower arms and
upper arms (much less my stomach) is unbelievable. I didn't deliberately
seek out the sun, of course... but apparently if you're walking around
in a sunny city all day, you still get sunburned. Huh.</p>
<p>(I'm happy to report that my £1 sunglasses and £2 sun-hat did an
excellent job of protecting my eyes and face.)</p>
