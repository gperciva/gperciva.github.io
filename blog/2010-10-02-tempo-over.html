<p>The online tempo experiment is now over; I am no longer collecting
information. You are welcome to continue playing the game if you find it
helpful, though! More information below.</p>
<p>Thanks so much for participating! We collected a total of 1041 games
played. Of these, 882 games had the human player agree with the
calculated tempo. In 89 games, the player disagreed with the calculated
tempo and gave their own tempo estimation, and 70 games had the player
disagree with the tempo without giving their own tempo estimation.</p>
<p>My task now is to examine all these games; my goal is to have "3-agent
agreement". For the "agreed with tempo" games, I need to check that I
agree that the tempo is good -- this means that the player, me, and the
computer all agree on the tempo. For both categories of "disagreed with
tempo", I need to figure out what the real tempo should be, then tweak
my algorithm so that the computer produces that tempo -- without ruining
any of the detected tempos of the "agreed" examples. And if there's any
disagreement between me and the player, I'll have to show the specific
examples to our resident professor emeritus of music so that he can give
a tie-breaking vote. And if he disagrees with both of us... well, there
will probably be so few of those games that I can just discuss them
individually in a special section of the paper. (I doubt there'll be any
of those, though)</p>
<p>A few people asked me privately about getting 100%, so I took a quick
glance at the games. The very best game had an average error of 1.25
milliseconds (this was on level 5), while the best game on level 1 had
an average error of 12.6 milliseconds. Mathematicians everywhere just
winced at my use of the word "average", so let me clarify that those
were the RMSE. The mean squared errors were 1.5*10^-6 and 1.5*10^-4,
respectively.</p>
<p>Those games were very much the exception, however -- most "great"
exercises had an "average" error of 30-40 milliseconds. This is just
based on me skimming through a list of hundreds of numbers, though... a
detailed (and non-subjective :) analysis will be coming in the next few
days.</p>
