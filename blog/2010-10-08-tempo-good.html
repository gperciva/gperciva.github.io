<p>Sorry for the delay for this analysis; sickness and wanting to have
everything finished interfered. It's not completely finished, but I have
enough interesting things to discuss for now. This blog post deals with
things that went well.</p>
<p>The best thing that happened was that you guys actually played the game!
:) I got much, much more data than I was expecting -- in the end, there
were 1041 tapping games played, with a total of 14,342 taps. I was
hoping for 200 or so tap-games, so this gives me five times as much data
as I was hoping for in my wildest dreams!</p>
<p>Of those tap-games, 882 resulted in the player accepting the computer's
tempo, 89 resulted in the player giving their own tempo, and 70 resulted
in a disagreement about tempo but no other tempo given. 635 tap-games
used an audio metronome, while 361 used a visual metronome, and 45 used
no metronome at all.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>Most tempi (plural of "tempo"; no, it's not "tempos") were very close to
the metronome -- looking at tap-games with user-agreed or user-specified
tempo, and excluding tap-games with no metronome, we find that 82.1% of
them had a difference of less than 5%, and 41.7% exercise had a
difference of less than 1%.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><img alt="image0" src="http://percival-music.ca/blogfiles/tempo-delta-moderate.png" style="width: 100.0%;"></div>
</div>
<p>The distribution of tap-games played per level shows an unsurprising
majority of level 1, but a surprising amount of interest in level 9. I'm
guessing that this is because the game was too easy (see next blog
post).</p>
<div class="line-block">

</div>
<p>Returning to main point of this experiment, 560 tap-games have their
tempo detected trivially with linear regression via ordinary least
squares. The player tapped the correct rhythm, with no note more than a
tenth of a quarter-note beat away from the strictly-metronomic position.
I call those the "boring" tap-games... I mean, if the obvious solution
works, then it's no fun! :)</p>
<p>Happily, this leaves 481 "interesting" tap-games which require more
complication solutions. I'm still working on this part; my latest
algorithm correctly identifies most of the tempi, but there's still a
bunch left, and I think my current approach isn't going to pan out. I
need to take a break for a day and return to it with a fresh mind.</p>
<p>Oh, on the topic of "boring" exercises -- judging from the data I've
been looking at manually, I estimate that approximately two thirds of
the tap-games can be handled with simple linear regression. The missing
hundred tap-games (between "two thirds of 1041" and the "560" mentioned
above) come from wanting to avoid false positives. I'm being paranoid
about false positives; I would rather have the computer spend more time
analyzing the taps instead of producing an incorrect tempo estimate.</p>
