<p>Digital Signal Processing can be so awesome it's scary. That's true of
any branch of mathematics, of course... but since I just reached this
point with convolution to aid the violin physical model, that's what
I'll talk about. With audio examples!</p>
<p>We've been working on a program that simulates a violin (called a
"physical model" in this the jargon, but it's not physical, and only
scientists use the word "model" in that fashion). We have a series of
equations that describe how the violin reacts when you pluck it, bow it,
put finger(s) on string(s), etc. We're using a lot of approximations and
known-to-be-inaccurate physics in this program; we're not trying to push
the boundaries of science in this area. We just want something that
behaves (and thus sounds) vaguely like a violin, so that people can hear
the difference that various bowings make.</p>
<p>In more precise terms, we give the computer a series of instructions
about the physical actions of a violinist, and the computer does them.
For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
time  action  extra
0.0   finger  D string  from-nut 0.109
0.0   bow     D string  from-bridge 0.12  -0.1 m/s  0.4 N
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This starts playing an E on the D string with a slow upbow (0.1 meters
per second) with moderate pressure (0.4 Newtons).</p>
<p>After summing the forces that the four violin strings exert onto the
bridge, we get the following sound:</p>
<blockquote>
<a class="reference external" href="http://percival-music.ca/blogfiles/twinkle-plain.wav.mp3">twinkle-plain.wav.mp3</a>
</blockquote>
<p>Why does this sound so bad? Well, the approximations we're making will
hurt the sound quality to some extent, but the biggest reason is that
I'm not doing anything fancy in terms of the playing (yet). I mean, even
the most accurate physical simulation can produce horrible noises. Don't
believe me? Give a violin to my father. A <em>real</em> violin is the most
accurate physical "simulation" imagineable, but it won't produce nice
sound unless it's played by a skilled violinist!</p>
<p>But I digress. Right now I'm excited about convolution of audio with an
impulse response.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>One neat trick I learned while doing my music degree at UVic was that
you can make audio sound like it's played in a room by taking it's
convolution with the impulse response of a room. Want to pretend that
you're singing karaoke in the Sistine Chapel, or the Met opera hall? All
you need to do is go to those places and record a clap. That's it -- a
single clap ("an impulse") is enough to make <em>any</em> piece of audio sound
like it was played in that environment.</p>
<p>When I heard that, I was like "woah!" [sic -- I'm trying to write like a
UVic music undergraduate].</p>
<p>But it didn't really sink in, because I hadn't actually tried doing it
myself. Like so many parts of mathematics, it doens't make sense until
you do it yourself. (which makes this whole blog post rather pointless,
of course)</p>
<p>The <em>really</em> cool thing, though, is that this applies to small things,
not just big rooms. In particular, it applies to the violin body.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>So my supervisor and I went down to the basement, wandered past all the
liquid nitrogen (or whatever was in those tanks) and hopped in the
anechoic chamber. After plugging in my supervisor's eee 901 netbook into
the microphone that somebody left in the room, I hit the violin a few
times with a dirty tea-spoon that we grabbed from our lounge.</p>
<p>Yeah. In the Centre for Music Technology, we're just <em>that</em> hardcore. A
week ago previous, we ended up measuring the weight of the violin bow
using a flat piece of metal (the leg of a speaker stand) as a lever, a
ball-point pen as fulcrum, and a slightly-drank pint of milk as the
counter-balance to the bow.</p>
<p>We went back upstairs, isolated one of those taps, and filtered it at 80
Hz to get rid of some background noise. (hey, there's noise everywhere,
even in an anechoic chamber!)</p>
<p>Here's the resulting sound:</p>
<blockquote>
<a class="reference external" href="http://percival-music.ca/blogfiles/impulse-2048.wav">impulse-2048</a>
</blockquote>
<p>If you think you missed something, nope -- that tiny click is all there
is. It's 2048 samples long (slightly longer than 46 millisceonds), and
that's actually way longer than it needs to be. Now we just need to
convolve those two pieces of audio together.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>The C code that does the magical convolution was simplicity in itself:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
double ViolinInstrument::body_impulse(double sample)
{
    body_ringbuffer[body_write_index] = sample;
    double result = 0.0;
    unsigned int bi=body_read_index;
    for (unsigned int ki=0; ki &lt; PC_KERNEL_SIZE; ki++) {
        result += body_ringbuffer[bi] * pc_kernel[ki];
        bi++;
        if (bi &gt;= PC_KERNEL_SIZE) {
            bi -= PC_KERNEL_SIZE;
        }
    }
    update_body_pointers();
    return result;
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>... ok, it you're not a programmer, that probably doesn't look simple.
The only important thing to note is that we're multiplying two numbers
together, then repeating that process, and adding up all the results
together. And also note that the two numbers we're multiply together are
simply the raw samples.</p>
<p>(if you know the math and you're worried about the reverse+shift...
don't be! That's done by the physics. The second function isn't actually
the recorded "bonk" noise; the "bonk" noise itself is already the
reverse+shifted version of the function)</p>
<p>The end result of the multiple+add is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<a class="reference external" href="http://percival-music.ca/blogfiles/twinkle-convolution.wav.mp3">twinkle-convolution.wav.mp3</a>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds much more like a violin, right? I think the mic placement wasn't
ideal, and it was a really cheap violin, but we can make more records
later with other violins. The important thing is that the basic system
is working... and that multiplying a simple tea-spoon-bonk can magically
change the sound in this way.</p>

<p>Oh, and I absolutely cannot resist adding a link to my favorite (and
sadly no longer updated) web-comic, talking about convolution: <a class="reference external" href="http://ansuz.sooke.bc.ca/bonobo-conspiracy/?i=381">a

clown is the supervisor -- this will be obvious to anybody in academia)</p>
