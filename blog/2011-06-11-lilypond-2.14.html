<p>I'm happy to announce the release of GNU LilyPond 2.14. LilyPond is a
music engraving program, devoted to producing the highest-quality sheet
music possible. It brings the aesthetics of traditionally engraved music
to computer printouts. Many improvements have been made in the past two
and a half years since the previous main stable version. (yes, that's a
long time between stable versions!)</p>
<div class="section" id="lilypond-is-doing-great-lilypond-is-headed-for-disaster">
<h2>LilyPond is doing great! LilyPond is headed for disaster!</h2>
<p>On one hand, we're doing great. The new stable version 2.14.0 is finally
out, we've finally started the <a class="reference external" href="http://lilypond.org/~graham/gop/">Grand Organization
Project</a> to resolve various
administrative problems, and there are no huge problems which will stop
us from releasing 2.16.0 in a few months.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we still have far too many tasks concentrated in far
too few people. This is not healthy, both for the individuals doing the
work, but also for the project as a whole.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sustainable-development-in-software-projects">
<h2>"Sustainable development" in software projects</h2>
<p>Every person will leave the LilyPond project sooner or later. Our lives
change, our hobbies shift, and unfortunately our health and lifespans
are not infinite. What would happen if, for example, I decided that my
PhD thesis and future career were more important than LilyPond and that
I should drop out the project?</p>
<p>(this is not an idle question; I honestly <em>should</em> quit LilyPond. Some
open-source volunteering would still be good for my career, but it would
be much more benefitial for me to spend that time on
<a class="reference external" href="http://marsyas.info/">Marsyas</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/">ChucK</a>, or even
<a class="reference external" href="https://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/stk/">STK</a> instead. Those
project are much more aligned with my research and potential
tenure-track jobs, and I would learn much more by working on them
instead of LilyPond.)</p>
<p>Such problems are charmingly referred to a project's <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor">Bus
factor</a>: how many people
would need to be hit by a bus before the project falls into disarray?
LilyPond has a quite low bus factor -- losing as few as three people
would cause massive problems.</p>
<p>I gave a
<a class="reference external" href="http://percival-music.ca/blog/2010-08-01-sustainable-development.html">presentation</a>
at RMLL 2010 about this last year, and I was reminded of this by a
recent <a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.gnome.org/bolsh/2011/05/31/effective-mentoring-programs/">discussion about mentoring
efforts</a>
by a gnome developer looking at the approximate 25% success rate (over a
variety of projects, including LilyPond).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="decentralization">
<h2>Decentralization</h2>
<p>A low "bus factor" means that work (or knowledge or power) is highly
concentrated in a few people. It's much better for the project if
work/knowledge/power is distributed more evenly -- losing one person
will cause fewer problems.</p>
<p>There are other benefits to decentralization, of course. A lower
workload on "central" people will lessen burn-out, which may encourage
them to stick around for longer. That can, in turn, lessen the workload
on other people: there are many cases where an "old-timer" can make a
few suggestions in a 5-minute email which save a new contributor
literally hours of work and frustration. Everybody wins!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dangers-of-burn-out">
<h2>Dangers of burn-out</h2>
<p>I'm (in)famous on the LilyPond mailing lists for arguing against new
proposals. "We don't have the resources / nice idea, but wait until... /
you can do that with a user .ly file / etc".</p>
<p>In some cases this is due to my subscribing in a certain philosophy of
design: <em>Il semble que la perfection soit atteinte non quand il n'y a
plus rien à ajouter, mais quand il n'y a plus rien à retrancher.</em>
(perfection is finally attained not when there is no longer anything to
add, but when there is no longer anything to take away; from <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Antoine_de_Saint_Exup%C3%A9ry">quotes
from Antoine de Sainte
Exupéry</a>).
A similar idea was mentioned by Steve Jobs in a <a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.forbes.com/carminegallo/2011/05/16/steve-jobs-get-rid-of-the-crappy-stuff/">recent
interview</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus
on. But that's not what it means at all. It means saying no to the
hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully.
I'm actually as proud of the things we haven’t done as the things I
have done. Innovation is saying 'no' to 1,000 things.</blockquote>
<p>But the other part is that I simply don't want more work. Every single
time that somebody comes up to me with an excited new idea, it breaks my
heart because my first thought is "oh boy, now I need to express polite
enthusiasm". It doesn't matter if it's over email, in a chat, in a
meeting, or in a private conversation. Doesn't matter if it's from a
longtime developer or an unknown user. Doesn't matter if I think it's a
brilliant idea, an obvious but useful improvement, or a pie-in-the-sky
ludicrous concept. My first thought is always the same: "bleh, more
work".</p>
<p>At the moment, I'm committed to doing 10 hours of LilyPond work per
week. I've "saved up" a few hours from the previous two months
(including my vacation) because I knew that I'd be busier after 2.14
came out -- at the time of this writing, I have 12 hours of LilyPond
time left. Each Monday morning, I add 10 hours to that figure. By my
estimation, only considering the published <a class="reference external" href="http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.13/Documentation/contributor/grand-organization-project-_0028gop_0029">Grand Organization
Project</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.13/Documentation/contributor/grand-lilypond-input-syntax-standardization-_0028gliss_0029">Grand LilyPond Input Syntax
Standardization</a>
backlogs, I won't be able to do make any LilyPond bugfixes or new
features of my own until the end of 2011. My entire time will be spent
organizing and helping other people to do work.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="you-can-help">
<h2>You can help</h2>
<p>Get involved! Anything that makes LilyPond less centralized will help.</p>
<p>Even if it has nothing to do with me personally, there will probably be
a "trickle up" effect from reducing the burden of other people. For
example, if a translator started doing some of the work of Francisco
(the Translation Meister), he would have more time to investigate
problems himself instead of asking me to help. Similarly, if a developer
offers to seriously mentor one or two new programmers, that might mean
one or two fewer programmers who come to me for help because everybody
else is ignoring them. If you're a new contributor, then spend some
extra time talking to other new contributors -- provide moral support
and somebody to commiserate with, even if you can't discuss anything
technical!</p>
<p>As for me personally... I spend about 2 hours a week on completely
mindless administration. Stuff that could almost be done by a computer
program. I could easily write 5 or 6 sentences on paper, and somebody
could follow those blindly. For example, twice a week I send a "patches
countdown" email.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>go to the <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/lilypond/issues/list?can=2&amp;q=label:patch%20patch=review&amp;sort=patch&amp;colspec=ID%20Type%20Status%20Priority%20Stars%20Owner%20Patch%20Summary">list of patches for
review</a>
</li>
<li>pick two or three issues</li>
<li>find the codereview URL inside the issue</li>
<li>click on that link</li>
<li>if there are any reviews, check that the last review is not negative</li>
<li>include the subject line and link to the codereview page in an email
to lilypond-devel</li>
</ol>
<p>All I need to offload this task is a reliable person who doesn't mind a
bit of boredom offering to do it. 15 minutes, twice a week. If there's
anything unusual, I'm happy to discuss it (and possibly modify the
instructions to handle such cases). But I'm not asking for any knowledge
or creativity.</p>
<p>There are other tasks which <em>would</em> require knowledge and/or creativity.
For example, many people ask for a changelog -- what's new in each
release? If somebody is interested in lilypond development, they could
spend 1-2 hours a week reading the developer email list and the git
changelog, then writing a 3-4 sentence summary for each release. That
would be a nice "gentle" introduction to how things work, and it would
benefit many users.</p>
<p>Similarly, there are some tasks which are regular weekly affairs, and
others which are one-time. Here's a great non-really-technical one-time
task: our list of <a class="reference external" href="http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.15/Documentation/contributor/major-release-checklist">places to send release announcements
to</a>
is quite old. Half of the links don't work. So I haven't bothered to
make any release announcements (other than our own webpage) at all. If
somebody wanted to spread the word, they could spend 2-5 hours looking
for relevant places to announce lilypond, maybe asking for other
suggestions from lilypond-user, and make a nice list. Then either send
our release announcement to those places himself, or else ask me to do
it. I wouldn't mind doing it as long as all the links work and I don't
need to hunt around to find out how to send the announcement (i.e. give
me a specific link to the announcement form, not a generic link to the
main website!)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="square-pegs-into-round-holes">
<h2>Square pegs into round holes</h2>
<p>In the past, we haven't done a good job of organizing people in
LilyPond. Some people are suited to regular work; other people are
suited to one-time jobs. Some people like technical challenges and
creative freedom; other people prefer a rigid set of guidelines so they
know that they're not making any mistakes.</p>
<p>We need people for all sorts of tasks, and over the next few weeks, I'm
really going to try to make sure that everybody has a job that suits
them. We've lost a lot of potential effort by asking people to do tasks
which don't really appeal to them, and then not having those jobs "open"
when another person offers to help.</p>
