<div class="line">Ubuntu 10.04 LTS has a serious bug in ssh/ssh-agent/something which
causes it to fail to log in to a system even if you have your ssh
identies set up. This caused me an hour of panic before I found a
workaround. I'm putting it here in case somebody else has the same
problem and google finds this for them. (tl;dr: use
<tt class="docutils literal">SSH_AUTH_SOCK=0sshfoo.bar.baz</tt> )</div>
</div>
<p>I swap between two laptops and a desktop regularly. I have a shared
dotfiles git repository, so my normal settings are fine -- but that
won't work for stuff like email passwords, or even email. My current
setup is to use an sd card for personal stuff. (yes, my stuff is in an
encrypted loop-back partition on that card; I'm not crazy!)</p>
<p>A few days ago (just after returning to Glasgow), I started having read
errors on the card. This was particularly sucky because although I'd
bought a new 16gb card while in Vancouver, I hadn't gotten around to
carrying that new card, so I was using my old 8gb card. I was planning
on doing it "soon", but I definitely started to kick myself for not
getting it set up sooner.</p>
<p>That said, it was only about 24 hours since I'd made a backup of the sd
card anyway, and there hadn't been any truly important emails in that
time. (I know the story should go "... but I didn't mind, because I'm
using my brother's tarsnap backup service", but it was actually about 3
days since I'd backed up in tarsnap)</p>
<p>Fortunately, when I put the card in a different laptop, it read it just
fine. I copied stuff over, checked that things seemed ok, and then
started using the new card regularly. Everything seemed fine for a day
or two, when I discovered that I couldn't log in to various servers. At
this point, I turned to tarsnap to get a backup of my <tt class="docutils literal">ssh</tt> directory,
thinking that I'd gotten some freaky bitrot in my private key but
nowhere else. No joy.</p>
<p>But wait, it gets worse! Take a look at this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
gperciva@gperciva-desktop:~$ ssh -v strauss.elec.gla.ac.uk
OpenSSH_5.3p1 Debian-3ubuntu7, OpenSSL 0.9.8k 25 Mar 2009

</pre>
<p>LOLwut? Server accepts key, agent admitted failure to sign in using the
key?!</p>
<p>After a bit of stumbling around, I found a <a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-keyring/+bug/201786">ssh bug
report</a>
from 2008 in the ubuntu database. Apparently you can work around it by
setting <tt class="docutils literal">SSH_AUTH_SOCK=0</tt>. You can also do some weird stuff with
something called "seahorse", but I think I'll just export the variable.</p>
