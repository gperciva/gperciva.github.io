<p>When I first heard about the Roomba robotic vacuum cleaner, it
sounded like something for the truly lazy -- how hard is it to
spend ten minutes vacuuming your floor once a week?</p>
<p>Then I tried it.</p>
<p>When I first moved into my condo, I borrowed my brother's Roomba
for a week.  By chance, my parents went on holiday for two weeks
after that, so I borrowed their Roomba.  By that point, I was
hooked.</p>
<p>You see, it's not a matter of "vacuuming your floor once a
<em>week</em>".  When I had a robotic cleaner with an easily-cleanable
dustbin, I ran it once a <em>day</em>.  And that wasn't me being paranoid
-- I emptied that dustbin every day so I could see how much dust
it was removing from my environment.</p>
<p>After 2.5 years of use, my Roomba started showing a blue starfish
error light, and it made a "clunking" sound as if it couldn't get
into gear.  Time for some serious cleaning!</p>
<div class="section" id="cleaning">
<h2>Cleaning</h2>
<p>(There's a few youtube videos about this floating around, but I
was annoyed at having to watch a 5-minute video to get this info
when a few images and text would have done it just fine.)</p>
<p>First, remove the yellow brushes (with 1 small screw) and the 4
main screws:</p>
<p><img alt="image1" src="../images/roomba-cleaning/roomba-cleaning-1.jpg" style="width: 565.0px;"></p>
<p>Next, remove the 4 small screws holding the blue-and-grey "brush
box" and lift it out:</p>
<p><img alt="image2" src="../images/roomba-cleaning/roomba-cleaning-2.jpg" style="width: 565.0px;"></p>
<p>Now bend the blue arms backwards so that you can pop the grey
plastic out.  There's a wire connecting the back of the blue and
grey part (see the next two images), which you can leave
connected:</p>
<p><img alt="image3" src="../images/roomba-cleaning/roomba-cleaning-3.jpg" style="width: 475.0px;"></p>
<p>This is sufficiently detached.  Look at the right-hand side of the
grey box (in the below image).  You want to undo 5 screws.</p>
<p><img alt="image4" src="../images/roomba-cleaning/roomba-cleaning-4.jpg" style="width: 816.0px;"></p>
<p>Here's the gear-box!  Looks fairly icky thanks to my long hair:</p>
<p><img alt="image5" src="../images/roomba-cleaning/roomba-cleaning-5.jpg" style="width: 500.0px;"></p>
<p>Close-up of one of the gears.  Some of those gear-teeth are
completely jammed with dust (a bit hard to tell since the dust
reflected the light):</p>
<p><img alt="image6" src="../images/roomba-cleaning/roomba-cleaning-6.jpg" style="width: 500.0px;"></p>
<p>In addition to removing the hair, I also used a small screwdriver
to clean out the gear-teeth.  I happily put the Roomba back
together again -- but the problem persisted.</p>
<p>After a few more disassembly-and-cleaning attempts, it occurred to
em that in addition to removing the hair and dust, I'd also
removed any grease and oil.  I added some bicycle grease, put it
back together, and the Roomba worked perfectly!</p>
<p>(I suspect that bicycle grease isn't ideal type of lubricant for
this purpose, but that's what I had easily available to me.)</p>
