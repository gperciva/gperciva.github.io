<p>I'm finally "here" now -- I just finished unpacking my bags. 4 weeks
isn't too bad for living out of a suitcase, right? ... right? I also
bought some flip-flops. It'll feel really weird to be wandering around
in them (especially on the MRT and busses), but when in Rome, do what
the Romans do, lah!</p>
<p>Last Saturday, I had to brave downtown Singapore. Well, maybe I didn't
have to... but the closest music store (I mean, a real music store, ie
one that sells musical instruments, not CDs) I could find was downtown.
At the Esperante mall, which is at the Esperante theatre, which is
Singapore's version of the Sydney opera house. Real swank, in (what
seemed to me) the best part of town, etc.</p>
<p>I had to walk through prime tourist terrority to get there, though...
for that matter, the whole complex was tourist territory. It wasn't as
horrible as I thought it would be, but I still felt like an idiot.
Especially since I was wearing a "Canada" t-shirt, since it had the most
red of all my clothing. Red is an auspicious color for the Chinese New
Year, which is apparently 15 days long.</p>
<p>In the evening, my supervisor had a "Spring music evening" party. Almost
all his 14 students (including research staff) came, as did four or five
professors and assorted wives and boyfriends (I'm pretty certain that
was the exact breakdown). I know that all you Canadians don't believe
that anybody can have "spring" stuff now. Neither do I, albeit for a
different reason -- it feels like summer here. Although everybody's been
saying how I came at the best part of the year because it's so cool and
refreshing. WTM?! 30 degrees is `cool' now?!</p>
<p>Anyway, all the students did something musical. About of them did
Chinese pop karaoke (complete with youtube videos for the background
music), while the other half played guitar, sang (non-karaoke), and
played piano. One guy did some magic tricks, and I improvised three
pieces on the violin. I only had 10 minutes to practice violin in the
afternoon (oh, I didn't mention: I was buying a shoulder rest and rosin.
I could play without a shoulder rest, but the bow was in desperate need
of rosin, so I hadn't practiced in the previous few weeks), but it came
off relatively ok.</p>
<p>Monday lunch was a Chinese banquet (on the 8th day of the new year) for
the School of Computing. It began with a... well, until today I thought
that everybody here was calling it line dancing. I couldn't figure out
what on earth Texas line dancing had to do with the Chinese New Year,
but I always just nodded and smiled.</p>
<p>Turns out that everybody was talking about "lion dancing", not "line
dancing". Whoops. Part of my confusion is that my vague memories of the
Chinese New Year in Vancouver -- stemming from a grade 5 or 6 project on
multiculturalism -- talked about "dragon dance", wherein a dozen or so
people would dress up as a dragon and parade around.</p>
<p>I asked my supervisor about this after the banquet, and he'd never heard
of "dragon dancing". I'll also note that the group at the lunch -- I'm
sure they were professionals; they were very good -- only had two people
in the costume. The quick, sharp movements were the same, as was the
lavish costume. Maybe one area of China does a 12-person costume dance
("dragon"), while another area does a 2-person costume dance ("lion")?
Or maybe the Vancouver version has evolved from the original Chinese
tradition? Or maybe I'm misremembering from my elementary school classes
20 years ago and getting confused with the dragonboat races.</p>
<p>The actual lunch was an 8-course affair. Unfortunately it was quite
lavish... luckily I had chickened out and declared myself a vegetarian
for the affair, otherwise it would have been a disaster. Oh, for those
who don't know: I'm very contrarian with food. The more expensive the
food is, the less likely I am to tolerate it. If a meal costs more than
about $10, I'm into "choking down the food (or not) to be polite"
territory. There's no question of me actually enjoying the food. That's
why I turned down a $75 salmon meal at the Empress Hotel in Victoria at
ISMIR 2006 -- I enjoyed my $0.99 Kraft macaroni and cheese (plus about
$0.20 in ketchup and $0.50 in diet coke) at home that night much more
than I would have the banquet.</p>
<p>Anyway, it was all vegetarian stuff, so I could eat it without qualms.
Other than the vegetarian shark fin soup. That was really thick -- it
almost seemed like jelly! Even though it was vegetarian, the texture was
so off-putting that I gave up after a dozen spoonfuls.</p>
<p>The location was really fancy -- it was the "alumni house" or "guild
hall" (I heard it referred to by both names). Quite new, and quite
expensive-looking. Not quite "Four Seasons" or "Pan Pacific" expensive
(those are swanky hotels in Vancouver), but definitely on par or better
than most places in downtown Vancouver. Not that I really know what
there is in downtown Vancouver, since I avoid downtowns like the plague.</p>
<p>Anyway, I seem to be well-established here. There's still one local shop
I should check out -- a "comic house". I'm not certain if it's a manga
cafe (pay an hourly rate to read whatever books you want) or a store...
and I'm not certain if they have Japanese manga or just books from other
countries... but I figure that I should take a look. Buying real manga
in Asia definitely seems like a worthwhile thing to do.</p>
<p>Then I think I'll check out the Chinese Garden. It's also within walking
distance. So I might start doing really touristy things on the weekend
after next... I'm not really breaking my resolve to do tourist stuff
once a week; it's just that the local streets are sufficietly novel that
I think they qualify. Everybody here says that it's good that I'm only
staying for 5 months because otherwise I'd get bored with Singapore
because it's such a small island... but I really don't think that'll
happen. I mean, if it takes me a month to almost cover the area within a
5-minute walk of my house, I can't possibly imagine covering even a
quarter of the island in 5 months.</p>
<p>Also, it rained for the first time today. I went outside and walking
around in it; it was quite a downpour. On par with the heaviest rain
I've seen in Vancouver. The rain gutters were very impressive! They were
one of the first things I noticed about Singapore, but I always thought
they were overkill. But having seen the massive downpours that we get
here, I think they're very appropriate. Setting up the entire island
with this system to both provide appropriate drainage and save water for
consuption was a very smart move by the government. I have no idea how
much it cost to implement the system, but it can't have been cheap.</p>

<p>More answers to emailed questions.</p>
<p>Yes, I've definitely been getting work down. The jianqu version of MEWER
is almost complete -- I reached the point where I know how to do all of
the iphone interface stuff I need, so it's time to rewrite my project
with proper software engineering practices, instead of throwing
everything together.</p>
<p>On Friday, we were finally able to purchase the iphone developer
license. It took Apple a full week to fix their Apple Store so that we
could purchase it from Singapore. I could buy the license by ssh'ing
into a computer at UVic that I still had access to and using lynx.
Text-based SSL-encrypted web-browsing for teh win! But I didn't want to
buy the license myself, since I'm leaving this group in four months.
It's more useful if one of the PhD students here buys it.</p>
<p>Anyway, that prompted a flurry of activity on Saturday when we could
actually begin testing. I immediately tried to do a trill -- none of the
other people thought to try this, but it was obvious to me as a musician
that this was the best way to test the overall system -- and was
disgusted at the results. But after half an hour (with corrections to
both the client and the server) we had it working quite well.</p>
<p>As a side note, I'm not impressed with MVC (model-controller-view). I
definitely see the point in separating the logic from the interface, but
I just can't see a separate Controller as being truly useful. I mean,
how many people really use multiple interfaces for exactly the same
code? I've written the rhythm game three times now, and each time I've
had to use a different language (1. Qt - C++ (or java or python with
bindings) 2. haXe (to create flash or javascript) 3. objective C (for
iphone)).</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">I'm even less impressed with Objective C. "Hey, let's take a language
with well-known syntax relying on () for functions, and add syntax
which relies on [] for functions in objects!" Seriously, you have code
like this:</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
for (int i = 0; i &lt; exerciseString.length; i++) {
  int c = [exerciseString charAtIndex:i];
  if (c==49) {
    [arrayExerciseOnsets addObject:[NSNumber valueFromInt:1]];
    int x = (480 - xOffsetR - xOffsetL) / exerciseString.length;
    CGDrawRectangle (ctx, x, 0, 2, 50);
  }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
<div class="line">Yuck! Ok, my use of a "magic number" is bad, but '1' doesn't work due
to the magic of UTF-8 string handling. Specifying the ASCII value
*does* work. Also, I'm mixing Model and View stuff here -- I'm not
actually doing this in my program; I artificially dumped them together
so you could see the wonders of [objective C] with pure C
object-oriented code... all directly from the Apple docs. I mean, the
Objective-C [object method:parameter] syntax is silly enough, but when
they encourage you to use CoreGraphics with the pure C-style
<tt class="docutils literal">CGFooBar( pointer_to_drawing_context, my, real, parameters);</tt> ...
I'm left shaking my head in disbelief.</div>

<p>Back to normal life! The most complicated meal I've made so far is
tuna-fish melt. Sliced bread, tuna, and a slice of processed cheese,
into a microwave for 30 seconds, and then adding ketchup. If I could
find macaroni and cheese here, or if the street food wasn't so cheap,
I'd do more cooking. But there really isn't any point in it -- if all
the stores weren't closed for the LNY, I wouldn't have even bothered
with the tuna-fish.</p>
<p>Singapore TV seems to be sit-com-like dramas. I saw a TV schedule by
reading a magazine over the shoulder of somebody in the MRT once, and it
listed Battle Star Galactica as being on at 11pm, but I didn't stay
awake to check. There's 8 or 9 channels, and every time I've tried to
look for something all the shows have been news or been Asian dramas
(mostly in Chinese (or maybe Malay?), occasionally in Indian (or maybe
Indonesian?)). They have subtitles -- often in two languages, so I could
follow along if I wanted to. Oh wait; once I saw that BBC comedy with
the mute comedian. Mr. Bean? It was on air about 10-15 years ago.</p>

<p>... since no visit to a country on the other side of the world would be
complete without such a letter to one's parents.</p>
<p>Two days ago, I finally finished the complementary shampoo provided by
the apartment. I'd bought some shampoo here on the first weekend. It's
in a green plastic bottle and advertized itself "for long and smooth
hair 2-in-1 conditioner". I don't know what "smooth hair" is, but I
figured that since it was green it should be similar to the Pert Plus
(tm) 2-in-1 shampoo I use at home.</p>
<p>It works fine -- but it smells. Some kind of flowery scent. I checked
the bottle again, but nowhere does it say "smelly". Then again, 90% of
the text on the bottle is some foreign script (could be anything from
Arabic to Thai, if Thai is a language, and if Thai is a language that
doesn't use hieroglyphics).</p>
<p>What's worse is that the smell stays on my hair. When I was going to
(and returning from!) NUS yesterday for the proofreading, whenever there
was a gust of wind I'd smell it and think "hey, there's a girl right
behind me... oh wait, that's <strong>me</strong>". Of course, I'm way too cheap to
throw out a bottle of S$3.60 (CDN$ 3.25 or so) shampoo just because it
makes me smell like a girl.</p>
<p>At the same time, I'm aware that this puts me me one circle closer to
the center. Long, gorgeous, curly hair? Check. Putting said hair in a
braid? Check. Having a flowery-smelling braid? ... check. That would put
me with the gluttons, but I'd rather be on the sixth circle (heretics),
so let's also count being a classical musician, liking cats, and
enjoying teaching.</p>
<p>Oh well. At least I'll have absolutely no problem becoming a member of
the <a class="reference external" href="http://improbable.com/projects/hair/">Luxuriant Flowing Hair Club for
Scientists</a>. It's run by the
<a class="reference external" href="http://improbable.com/">Ig Nobel guys</a>, so it has to be highly
regarded!</p>
<p>I also did the dishes today in three batches. As you might have seen in
the pictures of my apartment, my roommates leave everything in the
drying area. As a general rule, I have nothing against this -- as long
as there's enough room in the drying area to hold all the plates and
cutlery. Sadly, there isn't enough room here... and besides, some of the
"clean" stuff didn't seem very clean. So I put washed everything, dried
it, put it away in cupboards, and then did another load.</p>
<p>I actually enjoy housework. When I'm the mood, that is. I like making
things clean, and I don't need to think about it. It's a nice break from
programming, writing, proofreading, and all the normal stuff in my life.</p>
