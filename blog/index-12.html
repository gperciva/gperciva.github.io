<p>I finally got around to uploading the pictures from my "tourist trip" to
the so-called Chinese Gardens. They're a 3-minute walk from my
apartment, so I figured it would be an easy way to satisfy my "tourist
thing" without involving too much hassle. I have to say, though, I was
underwhelmed.</p>
<p>The grounds themselves reminded me of Vanier Park -- that's the park in
Vancouver that's next to the museum, planetarium, and the Vancouver
Academy of Music. It has same kind of grassy hills, light forest, a few
streams and ponds, etc. Granted, the architecture of the buildings is
different... but I didn't find that to be such a big deal.</p>
<p>The Chinese Gardens also contained a "Live tortoise and turtle museum",
which was every bit as boring as it sounds. I'm really starting to
re-evaluate my whole "do one tourist thing each week" -- I'm a terrible
tourist. I mean, I'd never dream of going to a zoo or temple or special
waterfall or whatnot in Canada, so why on earth am I forcing myself to
do that here?</p>
<p>In a similar vein, my "tourist activity" tomorrow (this report is 6 days
late) is running around the nearby lake. I don't know how long it is...
when I glanced at a map, it looked smaller than Burnaby Lake (which is
11.6km around), but now I'm wondering if it's actually bigger. I should
know tomorrow; if it takes me more than an hour to get around it, it's
definitely bigger than Burnaby Lake. (to my family: yes, I'm definitely
taking a water bottle with me. And this first time, I'm not going to do
my "absolutely cannot stop for any reason" thing. I'll stop, drink, look
at any maps that are posted, etc.)</p>

<p>Happy Friday the 13th! Today's English lesson featured me being lazy.</p>
<p>I began by spending 20 minutes showing the mistakes in last week's
papers, discussing a few other mistakes that I didn't add deliberately
(I mentioned the sigh "mistake" about the multiple holy grails,
explained both sides, and let them make up their own minds). I also
pointed out that the problems I added deliberately were common ones in
their own writing (I'll keep on adding such mistakes), and ended with a
few remarks about professors being human, too.</p>
<p>I suppose that last bit deserves some more explanation -- I was
suggesting that a few jokes or slightly less formal language could be
good. If the paper isn't engaging, you'll lose titles. At a conference,
your choice of title alone could double your audience. Remember your
readers: they've just been on a plane for 10 hours, they're jetlagged,
they meet a lot of old friends and collegues, and they're scanning the
paper titles. You're competing against the other presentation(s) that
are occurring at the same time, having coffee or beer with collegues
from around the world, or simply returning to the hotel to sleep. If you
want an audience, you'd better make the title worth it!</p>
<p>Err, I still didn't explain it. Despite the common opinion amongst most
undergraduates and first-year graduate students, professors are not
mindless automata who do nothing but read papers in stuffy, formal
English. Frankly, nobody likes formal English, let alone profesors.
Other than possibly my father. If you have sufficient command of the
language -- and I must admit that most of them don't -- then spice it up
a bit! In a tasteful way, of course.</p>
<p>In the similar vein -- actually, mostly because I didn't start it until
9:30pm on Thurs night and was too tired to pretend I had a pole up...
err, I think naughty words might be censored here... *cough* anyway --
my paper for this week is written in a distinctly informal style: <a class="reference external" href="http://percival-music.ca/blogfiles/doing-real-work.pdf">Ideas
are a dime a
dozen</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike the previous (and future) papers, I didn't add any deliberate
mistakes. Of course, in this informal style, sentence fragments like
"Get real." are perfectly fine. That said, I can't break any rule of
grammar I please. So if you see any mistakes in it... mistakes that
don't follow the style of that style of writing... please let me know.
I'll be putting an updated version of this on their English wiki in a
few days.</p>

<p>PS I'm not actually quite as dismissive of position papers and surveys
as this paper suggests. The history here is that I've received about ten
papers forwarded from people in the group saying "there are some
fantastic ideas in this paper!", when upon examination I found nothing
that would be at all novel to the UVic MISTIC group. Now, maybe the UVic
crowd are all super-smart or something, but I suspect that the problem
is simply that these kids don't know the field.</p>

<p>I held my first English session on Friday. It seemed to go fairly well,
although I won't really know until I see their papers.</p>
<p>I told everybody write a 1-page introduction to a (possibly fictional)
academic paper. On Friday, we all gave our papers to somebody else to
peer edit. Next Friday, they'll do the same thing (after fixing
mistakes), or hand it in to me.</p>
<p>I tried to scare them by emphasizing that it's a waste of my time to fix
spelling mistakes or grammatical mistakes -- almost all of them have
enough English skills that they can fix those things. Instead, I should
be working on issues of organization and style -- pointing out how to
make things sound more natural. I warned them that if I found obvious
spelling or grammatical mistakes, I wouldn't spend any time on the more
interesting issues, and they would have wasted their chance to get
useful feedback from me.</p>
<p>I added a page to the group's wiki: <a class="reference external" href="http://m3r.comp.nus.edu.sg/wiki/index.php/English">English
sessions</a>. If you
have any suggestions for other things to do, I'm all for it. My current
plan is to do the same thing every Friday.</p>
<p>Oh, and I also wrote a 1-page paper introduction. Mine was about a
fictional "tongue-based music browsing" project. It started as a total
spoof, but now I actually think it might be a worthwhile paper to do.
I'm certain it could be published in ISMIR... unless somebody else has
already done it. I didn't bother looking for any related work. :)</p>
<p>Oh yeah, one final note: so that the person proofreading my work
wouldn't get too bored, I deliberately added a number of mistakes to my
paper. I aimed for common mistakes that I've noticed in their own
writing. Test your own proofreading skills! See how many errors you can
find in <a class="reference external" href="http://percival-music.ca/blogfiles/tongue-browsing.pdf">Tip o' the
Tongue</a>!</p>
