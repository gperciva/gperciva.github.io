<p>Nothing particularly earth-shattering in this post.</p>
<p>As mentioned previous, I bought some sandals. I only worn them to
university for one day, because the straps were painfully wearing away
my skin. Is this normal for sandals? I don't think I've worn them since
I was 10 or so. Is it just because I bought cheap ones, or because the
skin on the top of my feet isn't calloused enough, or do sandals just
have a painful "wear-in" period?</p>
<p>I want cheese. Real cheese, not the plasticy stuff. I know, I've been
told where to look for it (Cold Storage, Marketplace, Carre Four), but I
haven't had any time. And I don't expect to find the time until after
April 17. :(</p>
<p>On a more positive note, I was complaining about the lack of pizza to my
project members, and one of them suggested the Munchy Monkey. I think
it's a student pub or something; it's a bit classier than the normal
food places on campus. But it did indeed have pizza! S$ 7.00 for a small
pizza. Compared to the S$ 2 or S$ 2.50 that a normal Chinese meal costs
this may seem like a lot, but it's definitely worth it to me! Besides, I
doubt I could find a similar pizza in Canada for CDN$ 6.00. This easily
doubles the attractiveness of NUS.</p>
<p>I tried running around Jurong lake last week -- this is the lake that's
right beside my house. Unfortunately, the street at the south side of
the lake doesn't have any pedestrian access -- no sidewalks, no
causeways, etc. So I had to turn around and home, dispirited. I mean,
it's one thing to force yourself to jog around a specific area (such as
a lake); it's another thing to force yourself to jog just for the sake
of jogging. I don't know if I'll try jogging again in Singapore.</p>
<p>Singapore websites are quite unfriendly. Lots of javascript and flash,
which means that 1) they're slow to download, 2) they're slow to render
on a low-powered machine like this laptop, and 3) they often simply
don't work in a standard-compliant web-browser.</p>
<p>I need to get a book about Chinese humor or something, because nobody
here understands my jokes. For example, there's a Chinese folk /
children's song called "Dance of Youth". I started calling it "Dance of
Wolves", since they sound a bit familiar. Then I tried calling it
"Silence of the Lambs", and everybody just stared at me with stone-cold
faces. People back in Vancouver would understand! ... ok, maybe not
"people", but at least my brother would get that one.</p>
<p>My attempted pop culture references also fail. I started talking about
creating one monolithic application instead of having a dozen individual
applications, and they asked what "monolithic" was. I tried to explain
what a monolith was ("remember that huge black stone at the beginning of
2001? ... you know, that really famous space movie...?") and had an epic
fail. "Do you mean star wars?"</p>
<p>Of course, it's my fault for trying to jazz things up. I also find
myself using common English phrases -- "putting the cart before the ox",
"my bark is worse than my bite", etc. I don't know why; it's just part
of my instinctive "I should act this way in this situation". I mean,
nothing says that instincts are always right, but unless I have any
particular reason to doubt them, I act on them. I mean, that's what
instincts are, eh?</p>

<p>Nobody[1] really understands what I'm doing[2] when I talk about turning
ipods into musical instruments, so here's two videos of us playing
Twinkle. Yeah, I'm being true to my Suzuki roots.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">[1] Nobody other than people in the MISTIC lab at UVic.</div>
<div class="line">[2] Mao, I sound like a teenager.</div>
</div>
<p>We actually made the video so that we could give school administrators
and parents an idea of what we want to do with their kids, but I figured
that I'd jump on this opportunity. Oh, I made a joke yesterday about
wearing good clothes for the video, but I completely forgot about it
myself this morning. Not that my "Vancouver" t-shirt is horrible (...
other than this being the t-shirt that's leaking blue dye over all my
shirts when I was them. I should have used non-color-safe washing powder
back at home, to get it all out before I came here. Or maybe I should
just stop washing all my clothes in the same load... it doesn't look too
bad on previously-white t-shirts, but my now-light-blue socks might seem
a bit weird).</p>
<p>Also, the mix of instruments is terrible. You kind-of need to use your
imagination for the melody, and one of the drum noises is way too loud.</p>

<p>I just got back from the bathroom (no, don't worry, I'm not turning this
into twitter), where I had a huge shock (ok, that sounds even worse). As
I lifted up the hand-towel to dry my hands, a lizard shot up the wall
from behind the towel!</p>
<p>It was about 5cm long (including tail), and pale brown. And it was fast.
It moved about 30cm before I let out my gasp and jumped backwards. Ok,
granted I was too startled to react instantly... but it was fast. I
think I could beat it if we were running 10 meters or more, but its
acceleration was amazing. And it was quite at home running sideways
along a wall.</p>
<p>This is the first time (that I recall) that I've seen a lizard in real
life. And I'm on the 8th floor! I wouldn't freak out if I saw one in the
jungle, in the park bathroom (they're quite open, I guess to allow
breezes through), or at NUS (where there's jungle mixed with corridors.
But I didn't expect to see one after midnight in my apartment! Moths,
sure, but not a lizard!</p>
