<div class="line">Wow, Glasgow's reputation for being a trendy, exciting place is
certainly true. I've been here for slightly over 12 hours, and already
had a memorial (later correction: memorable) event! Of course, I'm
going to make you read the entire blog post before I talk about that
event.</div>
</div>
<p>After the airport, I went straight to my residence. No problems
"checking in" at 8:30am. The residence has a gate around it; if you look
at it on google maps (I put a link in an earlier post on the blog), the
entire cul-de-sac is gated. I'm at the western end of the cul-de-sac, on
the north side of the north-south west end.</p>
<p>... well, I'm sure that <em>somebody</em> understood what I meant there. Not
that it actually matters whether or not anybody can pinpoint me to
within 10 meters on google maps. If anybody comes to visit me, we'd
probably meet elsewhere, and anybody targeting a missile at me doesn't
need to be that accurate. :) Unless it's a small missile. But I'd hope
that I would merit a big missile.</p>
<p>Ok, tangents of dubious comedic value aside, I'm on the ground floor.
The flat consists of a relatively narrow corridor, with
institution-off-white walls, institution off-gray-brown carpets, and
institution thick metal doors. There's 5 bedrooms and one
kitchen/lounge.</p>
<p>The room was slightly larger than I expected, which is nice. Of course,
I had very small expectations (pun intended). There's plenty of storage
space -- maybe twice the "drawer" (well, shelves in a closet) space as I
had at home. I can now afford to have my underwear on a separate shelf
than my socks!! Are you guys as excited as I am?!~! LOLBBQ :-)</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>My bathroom initially stuck me as small -- there isn't enough room to
stretch out my arms and turn around. But then again, how often do you
need to twirl around in your bathroom flapping your arms?</p>
<p>That was a rhetorical question. Please don't answer. Especially not you.
(you know who you are)</p>
<p>Anyway, it comes with a shower "area" (with a curtain, but no door) and
no paper. That somewhat annoyed me. Or rather, it <em>would</em> have annoyed
me, if I wasn't overwhelmed with the newness of everything. But really,
I know that they want to save money, but they couldn't give everybody
one roll of industrial cardboard-like toilet paper? I mean, looking for
a Tesco's or Sainsbury's so I can buy toilet paper shouldn't be a top
priority when moving to a new continent. :(</p>
<p>This annoyance was mollified somewhat by a package (I think from the
Student Representative Council, although I wouldn't swear to that) with
various introductionary materials, flyers, coupons, plus a packet of
tissues, soaps, shampoo, some candies, and an energy drink (boost).</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>Enough of my underwear and bathroom fixation. Let's move on to important
matters: so far, I'd say that UVic has better-looking girls. I'm even
tempted to say that NUS has more attractive girls than Glasgow, although
the comparison is a bit dubious since Singapore weather suggests body
paint as adequate insulation, while Scottish weather suggests wool.</p>
<p>No, I never saw anybody wearing body paint in Singapore. Although the
<em>climate</em> suggested it, the culture did not. Instead, the culture
suggested jeans or shorts which <em>imitated</em> body paint. The tops were
relatively loose. I mean, in the "breezy" sense. Not the "coming off"
sense. At least, not during university hours. I don't know what happened
after that. (hey, Yang, Yinsheng, and Dillion? Are you still reading my
blog? I remember you guys being interested at my observational abilities
when we visited Sentosa Island and were at the airport, so I figured
that you'd be interested in more observations)</p>
<p>Ok, I'll get back to serious stuff now. Otherwise I'll never get to my
topless story.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>

<p>The walk to the university was fine; I cross one somewhat well-used
street at an intersection, but the rest has very light traffic. The park
and river have plenty of trees, bushes, and ivy. That's a relief to me;
I was half-expecting to see a bunch of lifeless, carefully mowed lawns
and sculpted trees. I'm sure that those exist -- actually, I recall
seeing some squash or croquet or cricket or whatever courts -- but
there's at least some patches of natural-seeming overgrown trees and
ivy. The creek moves along at a decent clip, too. It's definitely a
pleasant walk.</p>
<p>I wandered around for a bit, then had breakfast/supper at a Subway
restaurant. That's my total comfort food, but this particular one didn't
turn out well. They were out of tomatoes, didn't have barbecue sauce
(although the paper taped to the display case listed it), and the diet
coke was inexpertly mixed. To be fair, part of the reason that Subway
tasted so fantastic in Singapore was that I was almost always starving
when I went there, whereas this time I was merely hungry. Still, three
strikes is a substantial burden. I'll try a different location next
time. (I've already found two others... no, I wasn't actively looking
for them. :)</p>
<p>I met with my supervisor. There were three other students in the lab at
the time, and I met two others later. My supervisor then took me on a
tour of the building, meeting various academic assistants, the IT guys
to get my engineering computer account, various labs, etc.</p>
<p>After that, I followed a map that one of my lab-mates drew for me to
find the UK equivalent of radio shack. Unfortunately they were out of
US-&gt;UK physical power adaptors (£2.99), so I ended up buying a
US-&gt;UK transformer power adaptor. Thankfully it was only sale for
£11 off, so it was only £8.99. It makes a bit of noise, and
is much heavier, but I definitely needed one. I'll go back there in a
week or two and see if they have the physical adaptors, since they make
no noise and are far lighter. Hopefully I can give it to somebody who
visits from Canada.</p>
<p>I got some pizza on the way home, then went to sleep. The bed and sheets
are the most uncomfortable sleeping things I've ever seen, including the
camping gear I used as a youngster. I've never given much thought to
beds in the past, but I'm actually considering buying new sheets. It
would be difficult to do something about the actual mattress, much as
I'd love to junk it.</p>
<p>Anywya, I think this was around 1 or 2pm. I woke up at 7:30pm, and after
a bit of debate I decided I was too thirsty to try to get back to sleep.
I should have drank much more during the morning, since I was dehydrated
from the flight.</p>
<p>I found a nearby Tesco express, where I bought some packaged sandwiches
with a deal for chips (or crisps) and bottled water. I saved
£0.76, and got 10 Tesco points. Along with the toilet paper. It's
probably a toss-up as to which is worth more.</p>
<p>On the way back, I decided that I wanted to try proper UK food, so I
stopped at two pubs. The first stopped serving food at 8pm, and the next
stopped serving food at 9pm. Hmph.</p>
<p>I think I've discovered why the UK has a reputation for binge drinkers
-- you can't get bloody food by the time you get to a bloody pub, so
everybody ends up drinking alcohol with no food. I've heard that alcohol
hits you harder when you don't have food to digest it with.</p>
<p>I mean, seriously. It shouldn't be that hard to find food at 9pm. That's
not late. I saw some Asian take-out places that were open, but I
definitely wasn't in the mood to try such food. So I went home. I
noticed a vending machine in the general reception lounge, so I eagerly
went there to get coke. Unfortunately, it was only stocked with energy
drinks (?!?!). After some debate, I got some flourescent orange stuff. I
also got a mars bar, although the vending machine didn't deep-fry it.</p>
<p>In my flat, I discovered that the internet connection no longer worked.
Previously, I'd just plugged in the cable and DHCP worked; now I had to
go through a web-interface login thing. I had the login information, so
this was no problem. And after doing this, I could send email.</p>
<p>Anyway, I downloaded email, then sat in the kitchen to eat my cold
sandwiches with orange energy drink and salt and vinegar chips as a
private party. I finished the orange thingie, then opened one of the
bottled waters.</p>
<p>Except this was no ordinary bottled water -- this was MUTANT BOTTLED
SPRING WATER FROM THE NETHERWORLD!!~! Otherwise known as "disgusting
fizzy garbage".</p>
<p>My laptop was quickly sprinkled by sparkling disgusting fizzy garbage.
So what did I do? Well, I obviously grabbed the kitchen tissue which the
residence provided for us... not. I took of my t-shirt and used it to
soak up the spill.</p>
<p>Memorial (later correction: memorable) event: check if bottled water is
actually disgusting fizzy garbage. Do this before buying it (whee, I
saved £0.76... by purchasing £1.04 of undrinkable disgusting
fizzy garbage), but most importantly before opening it next to a laptop.</p>

<p>PS: I thought about beginning the last paragraph with "... and that's
when two of my flatmates, a pair of female gymnastics students from
Sweeden, walked in the door. They politely followed my example, and
soon..." but then I figured that since I haven't met any of my flatmates
yet, I shouldn't make such jokes.</p>
<p>PPS: I now <em>have</em> met one flatmate: he's from Luxemburg. I thought he
was Scottish (from the accent), but apparently everybody here thinks
he's from America. I have no idea how anybody can confuse his accent
with American, but I guess that just goes to show how confusing accents
can be...</p>

<p>I've arrived safely at Glasgow.</p>
<p>Check-in and security were uneventful. Flight included LCD displays, but
no power sockets for laptops. I watched a lot of TV shows. No problems
at the border, picking up luggage, or the taxi ride here.</p>
<p>I just discovered that my power converter only works for 2 sockets. My
laptop plug has 3 sockets. What a monumental mistake! I could have
<em>easily</em> spotted this at home, but I didn't bother to check, since my
previous netbook had a 2-prong power socket.</p>
<p>I also discovered that I forgot to bring a keyring. Oh well; those
aren't hard to find.</p>
<p>I'm keeping this message brief because I don't want to run out of power.
I'm sure that it won't be hard to find an electronics shop that has a
converter, but this <em>isn't</em> the kind of thing I wanted to be doing as
soon as I arrived. :(</p>
<p>PS: email isn't working, so if somebody sees this message and knows
people that desperately want to know that I've arrived safely, please
send an email on my behalf.</p>

<p>Great deals! 50% off! I'm leaving for Glasgow in 13.5 hours, so (almost)
everything must go!</p>
<p>Before going, I tried to sort out my affairs -- decide what to take,
clean up anything I want to keep but not take, and get rid of the rest.
It's worked out to almost exactly 50% of my worldly possessions!</p>
<p>I gave away 2 of my 4 laptops. One to a very worthy cause (an
open-source developer in the US with an astonishingly underpowered
computer), and the other to my brother to test FreeBSD stuff.</p>
<p>Clothes received the same treatment... taking 12 t-shirts, giving 13
away. Taking 3 sweaters, giving 4 away. I now have a garbage bag
completely full of clothes.</p>
<p>I have no idea how I ended up with 25 t-shirts, BTW. Or rather, I do:
everybody kept on giving my t-shirts, and (before now) I only got rid of
clothes when there were holes the size of pennies in them. What if
there's smaller holes? Hey, that just means that the cloth has adapted
itself to my body, so they're more comfortable to wear!</p>
<p>Anyway, my check-in bags are packed, and in the morning I only need to
slip my laptop inside my handbag. I'm all set!</p>
