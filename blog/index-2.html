<p>I attempted to do 21.2km (slightly more than a half marathon). I failed.</p>
<p>At 1 hour and 47 minutes -- that's almost an hour longer than I've ever
ran before -- my muscles stopped. I'd been getting gradually slower for
the past half hour; at the time I wasn't really going faster than a fast
walk. I wasn't panting at all, nor was my heart rate fast. My muscles
just stopped responding.</p>
<p>Actually, I had some difficulty earlier -- shortly after beginning my
second lap, my right knee started to hurt. I considered turning back,
but I stupidly decided to keep on going. Don't do this at home, boys and
girls. When you're panting and you generally hurt, sure, keep on
running. When you feel pain in your chest... well, you should probably
stop running, but I keep on going. When you start to lose circulation to
your fingers... again, that's probably a really bad sign and you should
slow down or stop, but I keep on going.</p>
<p>However, when your joints start to hurt, stop. I mean, even <em>I</em> will
stop (in the future) when that happens. And we've already established
that I take a lot of stupid risks while running.</p>
<p>Anyway, when my right knee was hurting, I limped along by putting more
weight on my left leg. After about 2km, my right knee felt ok (or just
stopped complaining), so I started running normally for a while. But
then I noticed that I was slowing down, and couldn't speed up again. I
wasn't out of breath, and I wasn't in pain... I just couldn't get my
muscles to move faster. After a while of that, I tripped slightly and
started walking, and couldn't start running again. I couldn't even walk
normally... it took me half an hour to reach the car, and a pair of
elderly ladies passed me. I was going <em>really</em> slowly.</p>
<p>Anyway, it was an interesting experience. I think I definitely qualify
as "injured" -- I couldn't get into bed without lifting my right leg
with my hands -- and it certainly qualifies as "self-inflicted" and
"caused by stupidity". But at the same time, the only way to learn about
this kind of thing is to experience it once or twice. I would have never
paid attention if anybody warned me about this before today... actually,
come to think of it, I think a few of my friends <em>did</em> warn me.</p>
<p>And I certainly chose the right time to do it -- I'm living with my
parents, with no immediate deadlines. I have a few days until I play in
orchestra or do any music teaching, so my daily life is relatively
untroubled by this injury. It'd be terrible if this happened at UVic --
I wouldn't be able to bike or walk to university. Now, I'm sure that my
landlord would have given me a car ride... but still, I'd rather not be
wandering around the university using the hand rails to pull myself up
stairs.</p>
<p>Yes, definitely a valuable experience. And hey, how often do you get to
say "yeah, I failed... I only ran for 17km without stopping"? :)</p>
<p>PS: running a marathon is definitely a "when", not an "if".</p>

<p>In the past month, I almost finished cleaning my room and wrote an NSERC
application (that's the main Canadian scholarship for grad students in
science and engineering). I've also been teaching viola, playing viola
in orchestra (they had too many violins and cellos, so I'm playing viola
to be helpful :(, and started a string quartet where I'm playing first
violin.</p>
<p>That's not much. I blame the Burnaby Public Library. :)</p>
<p>I've been catching up on all my favorite scifi/fantasy authors from the
past two years, reading approximately 1000 pages per day. But I'm
finally getting bored of leisure, and have started getting work done.
Including this site. :)</p>

<p>In the past month I've been running around Burnaby Lake, which is 10.6
km. The first time I went (less that 24 hours after returning from
Belfast), I did it in 52 minutes. After dividing by 1.06, that gives 49
minutes -- I became a "sub-50" 10k-er! :)</p>
<p>Next time was 49 minutes and 46 seconds for the 10.6km. Following time
was 51-something, followed by 48-56 and 48-36. I'm particularly happy
about the last one -- that was the first time that I did this run
without any chest pains. Not only could I run comfortably, but I even
set a new record!</p>
<p>I should explain: when I run, I <strong>run</strong>. My definition of a "good run"
is a run in which, when you spit and miss the ground (i.e. it dribbles
down your chin and/or shirt), you <em>don't care</em>. If you have the energy
left to care about your appearance, you clearly aren't running hard
enough.</p>
<p>(ok, I <em>do</em> wipe my face on my t-shirt. But I don't care about the way
the t-shirt looks afterwards)</p>
<p>This is particularly funny since I'm generally quite fussy -- some
people might say obsessive -- about being neat and tidy. People who know
me in person probably can't imagine me being drenched in sweat, gasping
for breath, with trails of spit hanging down my face. To be honest, even
<em>I</em> have difficulty imaging it, and I've been doing it for weeks.</p>
<p>Why am I doing it? To go up levels, of course!</p>
<p>A few years ago -- I think it was five, although I wouldn't swear to
that -- my kind-of sister dragged me out running. She want to start
running, but didn't want to go by herself. So we started running... we
were both terrible. We'd literally walk for two minutes, jog for thirty
seconds, and then walk for another two minutes to catch our breath. And
I wasn't just humoring her by stopping so quickly -- I really didn't
feel that I could jog for more than thirty seconds.</p>
<p>I don't know whether I physically couldn't jog (due to muscles and bones
atrophying over the previous ten years), or whether I just mentally
couldn't jog (due to lacking sufficient determination to overcome the
pain). I'm not certain which one would be more pathetic, either.</p>
<p>Whatever the cause, it certainly <em>was</em> pathetic, so I decided to fix it.
Later on, when plans for Singapore were made, I became even more
determined to improve -- as an ambassador of the West Coast of Canada, I
couldn't do anything less than running 5km in 30 minutes. That turned
into 5km multiple times per week, which then became 5km in 25 minutes 5
days in a row, which turned into 10km in 50 minutes once a week.</p>
<p>Basically, instead of falling into the trap of MMORPGs
(massively-multiplayer online role-playing games), where you work and
work to kill monsters so you can go up levels for the reward of fighting
harder monsters so you can go up more levels, I've fallen into the trap
of working and working to run faster/longer, so that I can run even
faster/longer. Hence my obsession with my times and distances -- my
times are like my experience points, and reaching particular times
(e.g., "5km in 25 minutes", "10km in 50 minutes") represents going up
levels. What's the reward? Well, knowing that I've achieved level 7 in
Running.</p>
<p>Hey, it may sound stupid, but I'm sure that you'll admit that becoming a
Level 7 Runner (10km in 50 minutes) is still <strong>oodles</strong> better than
becoming a Level 50 Warlock in Worlds of Warcraft (tm).</p>
