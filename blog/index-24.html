<p>I was walking back home at 10am a few days ago, happily exhausted, and I
happened to notice a sloped lawn of some houses next to my residence.
That grass was really green! I then started looking around at other
grass -- the corner of a wooded area, stuff growing in cracks on the
pavement -- and yep, it was all really green. Much greener than the
grass in Vancouver!</p>
<p>Granted, the last time I was in Vancouver it was late summer; not
precisely a time noted for having lots of rain. And come to think of it,
I can remember looking out the kitchen window last year and being
surprised at how green the lawn looked. (especially my parent's
back-yard lawn)</p>
<p>But hey, it made a nice introduction to this blog post.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>My teaching ended almost two weeks ago, and I immediately shifted into
my "sleep whenever I want" schedule. This normally results in a 26-hour
sleep cycle (awake 17 hours, sleep 9 hours), but for the first time
ever, I ended up on a 14-hour cycle. Awake 9 hours, sleep 5!</p>
<p>I felt great, though. And it was useful to have the shorter cycle,
because it meant that I spent some time at university by myself (so I
could get work done), but also some time there when other people were
around (so they could test what I was working on).</p>
<p>Oh, as for "what I was working on"... half the lab is now in either
Australia or New Zealand, for a series of conferences and/or workshops.
I was preparing an electronic clarinet that plays in 19-tone equal
temperament and unearthing a two-year old version of rosegarden with a
19-tone equal temperament pitch tracker. I was happy to volunteer for
the task, but I underestimated the amount of work required.</p>
<p>I'm now porting the ancient rosegarden pitchtracker code to the latest
version (using Qt4 instead of Qt3). I'm happy to report that so far,
it's going exactly on schedule: this job should take a week.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>Granted, that's another week that I'm not doing research. Speaking of
research, I'm seriously reconsidering whether to include a metronome in
the rhythm game. About half the people I've showed the game to (and
everybody over here) have complained about the metronome. Or rather,
they've complained about having to follow the metronome. (yes, I'm sure
there's a pianist or singer or whatever joke in there somewhere)</p>
<p>But there is a serious issue there. I did a few quick tests on myself --
I had the computer give me a 4-beat metronome introduction (set to a
random number between 60 and 120 BPM), I tapped the rhythm, then the
computer told me my tempo. I generally varied between -5 BPM and +10
BPM. Now, I'm a great ensemble player. I'm not claiming on being the
best musician ever, but when it comes to rhythms, aligning rhythms,
keeping track of what everybody's playing, etc., I'm above average for a
classical musician with 20 years of training. So if I naturally vary the
tempo by that much, there's no point penalizing students for doing the
same!</p>
<p>Basically, "with metronome" tests your ability to play rhythms in a
large ensemble (say, an orchestra). But when you're playing chamber
music or in a private lesson, the tempo is much more flexible. I'd
estimate that in a normal "simon says" type of private lesson (teacher
claps a rhythm, then the student claps it back), the teacher wouldn't
complain if the student was +- 20% of her initial tempo -- and probably
wouldn't even notice if it was +- 10%. (yes, I should spend more time
looking at psychology papers to find exact numbers for these)</p>
<p>So I'm now thinking that the most useful rhythm training tool would give
an initial "target" tempo, but then stop the metronome and let people
clap or tap the rhythm. Technically, this means that I need to detect
the tempo of the student's exercise. This is a well-known problem in
Music Information Retrieval, but this application has special
constraints. First, it needs to be very reliable; we don't want to give
students bad grades because the tempo-detection algorithm gives the
wrong answer. Second, it needs to be robust against incorrect rhythms.
If somebody taps four 8th notes instead of four 16th notes, the tempo
detection should still work.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>All in all, it's looking like the actual rhythm survey won't happen
until January. This week is devoted to cleaning up the mess of previous
research in the group (i.e. the rosegarden thing); next week I'll start
the tempo detection in earnest.</p>

<p>Happiness is sitting in your university lab at 3:30am on Saturday
morning, with a cup of lukewarm tea made with two-day old milk that's
been sitting on a ledge outside the window because the fridge isn't
working, eating nothing but Mars bars for the past four hours because
nothing is open in the city, with half the lights turned off because
they flicker unbearably, finally alone after all the labmates had left,
and having implemented the Friedman test in python to check your
experimental data.</p>
<p>Actually, I'm not totally alone. There's still the Chinese postgrad in
the next lab. But that's far enough away that I consider myself alone.</p>
<p>I'm happy.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>The experimental data is looking quite good -- the planned "best case"
resulted in a p value of 0.00025. For those of you who remember as much
about statistics as I did three hours ago, this means "it's really
really really unlikely that the difference is due to random chance".
Which translates into "you're doing the right thing".</p>
<p>Another set of exercises resulted in a low p value but unexpected
results, which is exciting. The last two sets of exercises produced
unclear results... but that's the whole point of a preliminary survey.
As far as preliminary surveys go, I couldn't ask for anything better!</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>Residence heat: since the last report, we've lost heat twice and had it
repaired twice. We've had heat for the last 8 days, which is the longest
we've ever had it. Hopefully it'll last this time!</p>
<p>Speaking of heat, it's been disappointly warm outside. Ok, by "warm", I
mean "5-10C", which doesn't strike most people as warm... but I was
hoping for snow. Talking to my labmates, it doesn't sound like Glasgow
gets much snow. :(</p>
<p>Glasgow seems to have the same Fall weather as Vancouver, which makes me
quite at ease. Overcast, mixed rain and drizzle... that's the right kind
of weather! I think it's a bit windier here than in Vancouver, although
I might be mistaken since my bike path in Victoria didn't expose me to
much wind. The rain here is no problem at all, but the drainage is quite
poor: the sidewalk gains a few huge puddles -- at times, I walk along
the road to avoid the sidewalk-puddles! At other times, I scrunch up
against the fence away from the road, since the road has huge puddles
which turn into fountains when cars drive through them.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>On one such stormy and dark night, filled with chest-high
puddle-car-splooshes, I trotted off to the university chapel to turn
pages for a clarinet trio. For the non-classical musicians out there,
this means "clarinet, cello, and piano". I did a good job on my first
page-turning experience... I had to hold the page a few times as the
fans threatened to turn the page at the wrong time, and the pianist
thanked me for that extra duty.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>I've finished demonstrating for the first-year analog+digital
electronics class; the last two weeks were making a radio and making
some "christmas lights" (just a series of LEDs flashing in a particular
order). Next term, I'm teaching the first-year "introduction to C
programming" course with my supervisor. I'm really looking forward to
this -- especially since everybody (labmates, other postgrads, even
faculty!) warns me about how terrible it will be. Bah! I'm not afraid of
pointers, and I'm <em>definitely</em> not afraid of explaining them.</p>
<p>Next week, half the lab is going off to New Zealand (and maybe
Australia?) for 2 or 3 conferences. With that, as well as the
undergraduate teaching being over, I expect things to get much quieter.
I should really be able to catch up on my research! Oh, by the way, I
went off to a two-day workshop at the Open University at Milton Keynes a
few weeks ago. Not really much to say about that trip, other than I met
three people (one student, two professors) who were interested in my
work and who were doing related stuff.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>So, in the near future, I'll have much more time (and energy) for work.
I'm getting involved in the 19-tone equal temperament pitch tracker for
Rosegarden (we'll do the normal 12-tone as well, since most people would
much rather have that). As previously mentioned, my preliminary survey
of grading rhythmic exercises is done, so in the very near future I can
launch the real survey. And I've already started thinking about the
sheet music analysis + rhythm extraction + automatic exercise generation
project.</p>
<p>My sleep schedule has been quite poor, so I've decided to go back to my
26-hour cycle. That's a major contribution towards my happiness... not
having to worry about going to bed or waking up is a <em>huge</em> relief. I
need to do some teaching on Monday and Tuesday next week (filling in for
one of the people going to New Zealand), but after that my schedule will
be blissfully free for self-scheduled work.</p>

<p>You may recall me being very happy that our heater was fixed on 14 Oct.
Well, less than a week later, it broke again. You may recall me being
very happy that our heater was fixed on 2 Nov. Well, less than a week
later, it broke again.</p>
<p>I'll give them 2 days to fix it, and then I'm writing a formal letter to
the head of accommodation to remind them that their legal "residence
contract" specifies that it is the university's obligation as a landlord
to "ensure that there is kept in good repair and proper working order
any installations provided by the University for space heating" and
"provide gas and electricity". I haven't had any problems with
electricity, but the latter is just there in case they try to argue that
the heater is just fine; the problem was in the gas intake to the
heater.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>Other than that, things are fine. I was at the lab on Sat until 11pm,
and on Sunday until 9pm. It's really feeling like home! I'm doing a
pilot survey of rhythm grading, and it's really exciting watching the
answers trickle in. I had 5 responses within an hour of the initial
request, and 9 at the end of the first 20 hours.</p>
<p>Once the pilot survey is done, I'll make a better one (more specific
questions, informed by the results of the pilot survey) and ask for help
here. I think it might be bad experimental practice to re-use pilot
survey people in the real survey (I'll check with our psych person), so
I'm not looking for more people to do the first survey.</p>
<p>For teaching, we're doing ripple counters this week. Should be fun! It
took me an hour to get through the lab... I misread the lab sheet's
"connect the output of each flip-flop to the clock of the next
flip-flop" as "connection the output... to the <em>input</em> of the next
flip-flop", and ended up adding a bunch of needless logic gates to make
it count properly. When I finally checked the lab sheet again, because I
couldn't believe it was this complicated without more explanation, I
noticed my mistake and easily finished it off.</p>
<div class="line-block">

<p>We're going to London next week. Ok, not actually London; I think it's
Milton Keynes. If that's pronounced "milton keens". Apparently we fly
down to London, then take a coach for an hour to this place. In my
Canadian mind, anywhere reachable within an hour's drive of a place <em>is</em>
that place. So we're going to London.</p>
<p>(hmm, I guess that means that Glasgow <em>is</em> Edinburgh. Umm. I think most
people in both cities wouldn't like that!)</p>
<p>Yes, there were dark mutterings in the lab about the travel
arrangements... apparently they were brough about because it needed to
be booked during the summer, and one can't book train tickets more than
3 months in advance.</p>
<p>Anyway, it should be a fun little jaunt. Or a little jaunt, at least.
Apparently the place we're going to has "concrete cows", which sound
like they're either highly awesome or highly non-awesome.</p>
<p>Kind-of like being hot or not!</p>
