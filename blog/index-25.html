<p>My plans to <a class="reference external" href="../blog/2009-12-20-lilypond-addiction.html">managing my LilyPond
addiction</a> have been working
well. Ten days ago, I began restricting myself to 3 hours a day; I've
managed to stick to that. It's been immensely refreshing -- I'm no
longer managing a beast with an unending list of problems to work on.
Instead, I look at the problems, pick out the most important or most
unique (i.e. difficult for other people to work on) issues, and work on
those for my allotted time. Other issues are filed away in the bug
database, where somebody (possibly me) can work on them later.</p>
<p>Quite apart from the morale boost, this has given me time to get back to
my actual research. I have to admit that I was a bit surprised about how
easily I got back into it -- I'd forgotten how interesting it was. I'd
spent over a month working other stuff, both lilypond-specific, and
helping out other people in the lab.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>I've decided to reduce my lilypond time to 2 hours a day for the next
few months. This isn't part of a gradual withdrawl from lilypond [1];
rather, it's because I have a few conference paper deadlines in April
and May, and I want to make sure I do a good job on them.</p>
<p>(I'm not ruling this out at a later stage; it's a great way to force
other people to take over your tasks).</p>
<p>So the general rule is 2 hours a day. Any day that I'm not at home (i.e.
wake up and sleep at home) is an exception; depending on the
circumstances, I might spend more than 2 hours, or not do anything at
all. For normal days, my time will be prioritized as mentioned before:
urgent emails, mentoring contributors, non-urgent emails, then working
on various problems or feature requests.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>PS. no, this is not a "new year's resolution"; it's pure coincidence
that I switched to 3 hours ten days ago and started looking ahead at
what I wanted to get done in the next few months.</p>

<p>Since it's the end of term, it's time to look back and reflect. When
looking back, I see that I have a problem. I seem to be addicted to
working on LilyPond.</p>
<p>Like all great addictions, it doesn't even make sense. Yes, I first got
involved because I was using it for composition, it was a great piece of
software, and I wanted to give back to the community.</p>
<p>After a few years, I stopped composing, as I shifted from music
composition into teaching/performance and then into computer science.
But I kept on working on LilyPond. In fact, I did more than ever. I kept
on doing more and more.</p>
<p>In the past three days alone, I've exceeded 20 hours of LilyPond work.
Not "using lilypond for composition", not "using lilypond to generate
images for my PhD research", and definitely not "using lilypond to
research music notation or presentation or computational aesthetics" or
anything research-oriented like that. No, 20 hours of mentoring new
contributors, preparing the build system for the new website, getting
the 2.12.3 release out, discussing documentation restructuring, etc. No
wonder I've barely done 1 week of actual research over the past four
months!</p>
<p>This has to change.</p>
<p>I hereby announce that starting tomorrow (21 Dec 2009), I'm only going
to do 3 hours of lilypond work each day. That's still 21 hours a week,
which is very respectable for a volunteer job. And it's not going to
count working on other open-source projects; that time is separate from
lilypond time.</p>
<p>My time will be carefully prioritized:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Urgent emails.</li>
<li>Mentoring contributors, new and old.</li>
<li>Dealing with non-urgent emails.</li>
<li>Working on stuff that only I can work on (the Grand Unified Builder,
releases, and the website).</li>
<li>Working on complicated stuff that I can do much faster than other
people (large-scale documentation rearrangements, build system stuff,
etc).</li>
<li>Working on other issues.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'll record time in 15-minute blocks; when I reach 3 hours, I'll stop
for the day. My apologies in advance to any contributors who send me
questions after this cut-off; you'll have to wait until the next day.
Speaking of that, I define "a day" as "the period between waking up"; my
sleep schedule sometimes has no relation to the visibility of the sun.</p>
<p>This will undoubtedly slow down lilypond development -- if we have a lot
of new documentation contributors, then I'll be doing less release work.
And it would be quite difficult for anybody else to pick up that slack;
GUB is a beast to get running.</p>
<p>I make no apology for this; my time is my time, and I consider keeping
new contributors happy to be more important in the long term than having
more releases or better-quality releases. If anybody wants to volunteer
to mentor a few people, that would obviously reduce the burden on me,
thereby allowing me to spend more time on releases, the build system, or
whatever else occurs at a lower priority level.</p>

<p>Snowies! It finally snowed here! Snow makes everything so pretty... and
also reverts me to a mental age of 9 or so, when everybody would rush to
the windows whenever somebody said the magic word and watch the swirling
flakes with awe. I was actually jumping up and down in the lab this
afternoon. Fortunately, the lab was empty, so nobody knows my deeply
embarrassing secret.</p>
<p>Sadly, the snowfall only lasted about 20 minutes, and began to melt
immediately. I went food shopping 3 hours later, and the snow was almost
all gone -- replaced with ice. It melted, but then froze. There was a
fairly substantial amount of black ice around... not the most I've ever
seen, but definitely noticeable. Especially in my running shoes, which
turned out to be quite flat. I hadn't noticed it before, but they're
really not intended for slippery conditions.</p>
<p>On the heat front, it's still working. But the (deliberate) heating
times are inconvenient to say the least -- the residence only turns on
the heat for one hour in the morning, and from 18:30 to 23:30 at night.
If you come home at 17:00, you'd better be prepared to leave your jacket
on!</p>
<p>At first I thought the "heating times" were a quaint British custom
(like high prices and football violence), but when I mentioned it to a
labmate he was shocked. Apparently it's just one more instance of the
university accommodation sucking.</p>
<div class="line-block">

<p>Real work was delayed for another week: I've gotten involved in the
programming for the bow sensor project. This is real EE&amp;E programming --
it's on a PIC microcontroller (smaller than any of my fingernails). We
need to pore over the datasheet, figure out that if we put 0x50 into
register TXRDYSND.H and 0x01 into TXRDYSND.L, then we can put the value
we want to send into the TXTRMT.H / TXTRMT.L register pair. Different
registers have different functions depending on what you've put into
other registers previously. Fun!</p>
<p>I'm really enjoy this stuff. This microcontroller in particular is
collecting data from 4 or 5 different sensors, then sending it all over
a bluetooth chip. We have another bluetooth chip on the other end,
hooked up to a RS-232 port. The undergraduate is quite good at hardware,
and it's all his own design. So we do a combination of programming,
looking at the output on a scope, and sometimes even sticking a
multimeter on the wires or copper to check if any of the etched tracings
are accidentally touching. We think that happened once; after he
carefully scraped away a few places that were suspicious, the output
looked much better.</p>
<p>In case you're wondering, the bow sensor is a long-term project in the
lab (somebody's going to have to work on it in the future, and having
somebody with a passing knowledge of the system is will definitely make
that easier), and I checked with my supervisor before getting involved.
The guy's project is almost entirely the hardware, and in industry
they'd have a hardware+software guy working on it, so my involvement
isn't going to be a problem for his grade.</p>
<div class="line-block">

<p>Apparently it's Christmas soon. Feels like early Nov to me, but oh
well... I bought a pair of slippers for the lab. No, they're not the
wonderfully girly fuzzy slippers I got for home; there are "manly
house-wear", as the undergraduate put it. Dark blue, not fuzzy, etc. I
change into them as soon as I get to university.</p>
<p>I also finally bought a violin shoulder rest, and started practicing
Bach. No, I'm not going to say something horrible like "it eases my
loneliless". Nor am I going to say something even more horrible like
"playing Bach makes me realize that we're all together in a cosmic
sense". No, I'm practicing Bach (the second solo violin sonata or
partita, whichever was easier. It's the one that's all fairly easy,
until the last movement which is impossible) because it's an appropriate
level for me, and I need to get better before I can start playing in
public with other people. If I'd started earlier, then I'd be seriously
looking at joining an orchestra in the new year, but I doubt that I'll
be good enough. Also, having a £50 violin doesn't precisely help. Not
that I'm complaining -- a poor craftsman blames his tools. A good
musician should sound decent on any instrument; a poor tone quality
doesn't exist bad intonation or lack of bow control!</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>Buying that shoulder rest has caused me to re-evaluate my research
direction. The current plan was to a year really nailing the rhythms --
how do musicians perceive them, how can a computer grade like that,
analyzing music to automatically create meaningful rhythmic patterns,
etc. I still think that's not a bad idea.</p>
<p>However, there's nothing for me personally in it. Oh, I'm really looking
forward to doing the rhythmic analysis and whatnot... but I don't need
to practice rhythms. Violin intonation, on the other hand, I really do
need to practice. But in my original plan, I wouldn't even <em>start</em> that
for another year.</p>
<p>Now, I'm not thinking about abandoning rhythms -- I'm just musing with
the idea of banging out a quickie. Slap together a python application
for testing violin scales. Nothing fancy... no finger patterns, no
arpegios (although those wouldn't be hard to add), no grading mechanism
supported by extensive surveys of muscians, and no fancy graphics or
animations. Just an objective listener that gives me a score. Something
that stops me from blasting through stuff and saying "meh, close
enough".</p>
<p>It should only take a day or two... hey, that would make a nice
Christmas present for myself. "Merry Christmas, now start practicing
your scales seriously".</p>

<p>Last night (Saturday), I tried to do laundry three times, but there were
no free washers at 21:30, 22:30, and 23:45. This morning (Sunday), I
went there at 11:00 -- completely empty. I'm sure there's a joke in
there somewhere.</p>
