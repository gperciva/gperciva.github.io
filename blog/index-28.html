<p>On April 30, the department had a "day trip" to the Isle of Bute. I was
wondering whether to go or not, but when I discovered that there was a
Canada Hill on the island I had to go. Pictures included.</p>
<p>Sorry, the pics are from my mobile phone. It's not <em>too</em> terrible for
landscape photos, though.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I was struck by how small it was -- approximately 5000 people. I think
this was the first time I'd spent more than 10 minutes in a town/village
of that size. It was a bit weird; I couldn't imagine living there. I've
said previously that I preferred small towns (mainly comparing Victoria
to Vancouver), but I obviously need to amend that to preferring
"medium-sized cities". Somewhere between 100,000 and 200,000 people,
maybe?</p>
<p>Not really much else to say about the trip. I added funny comments to
most of the photos, so reading those is probably better than reading
more of this text.</p>

<p>Postgraduates students in the department of Electronics and Electrical
Engineering at the University of Glasgow are forced to submit our yearly
progress reports to the the plagiarism detection website "turn it in".
Leaving aside the questionable copyright and privacy issues involved in
tying academic progression to an independent for-profit company, I was
amused by how badly their "service" worked. I therefore created a

<p>All examples are presented in their entirety -- there wasn't more text
connected to the statistics example which I've omitted to make a joke.
It really complained about "mean is blah, standard deviation is blah".</p>
<p>Furthermore, the bibliography "similarity" was a huge portion. The
"similarity index" of my 20-page report was 10%, but when I select the
"exclude bibliograph" option, that dropped to 2%.</p>
<p>This is quite puzzling -- a bibliographic entries <em>should</em> be exactly
the same as other papers. I mean, given text like this:</p>
<blockquote>
G. Percival, Y. Wang, and G. Tzanetakis. "Effective Use of
Multimedia for Computer- Assisted Musical Instrument Tutoring". In
<em>EMME '07: Proceedings of the International Workshop on Educational
Multimedia and Multimedia Education</em>, pages 67â€“76, New York, NY,
USA, 2007. ACM Press.</blockquote>
<p>there's no other way to cite that article! (BTW, this was the citation
that I apparently "plagiarised" from the student in Bristol) I mean, any
deviation from the above would be <em>wrong</em>. Ok, I suppose I could omit
the page numbers, or write the conference name in a slightly different
manner (like omitting the "EMME '07" part)... but get real. The <em>best</em>
papers would cite articles in the same way, probably even using the
shared databases of bibtex entries like
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/">DBLP</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://liinwww.ira.uka.de/bibliography/">the Collection
of Computer Science
Bibliographies</a>, or getting
a bibtex entry directly from the publisher's website). What's more,
their "service" clearly identified my bibliography as such -- so why
complain about the similarity in citations? That just doesn't make
sense.</p>
<div class="line-block">

<p>I have nothing against computerized grading of student work -- I mean,
that's half my Masters, and will be half my PhD thesis. I'm quite aware
of the pressures on universities and colleges, and the overwhelming
amount of student cheating that goes on. There was an outrageous amount
of plagiarism going on in the course I was teaching, and it really
sucked to give grades to the cheaters (I lacked solid evidence) and see
hard-working (but non-cheating) students only complete two assignments
out of five. And technology definitely <em>can</em> play a role in keeping this
under control.</p>
<p>But that's no excuse for poorly-designed software and idiotic academic
policies. If the software can't handle submissions from people with
international publications, why is it being used on postgraduates at a
major university?! Restrict its use to undergraduates only -- there
might still be some problems with a few senior undergraduates having
published a paper or two, but those would be rare. But PhD students
should be expected to have a few publications before they start, and
will probably have 5-10 by the time they finish. There's only a few ways
to give a short history of "related work" in your area; of course you'll
use some phrases that you used in your previous publications!</p>
<hr class="docutils">
<p>Oh well. It provided a certain amount of amusement, and I don't
anticipate any problems when I meet with the faculty member who
evaluates my technical report and the "similarity report" about it. I
have to say, though, that I'm really wishing I stayed at UVic. This is
just insulting.</p>

<p>I ran into an unexpected problem in the programming class: these kids
can't do simple math. They couldn't figure out how to make changes (i.e.
items cost 12.74, given 20.00, print the number of coins to return).
They couldn't even follow an explanation of how to convert a number of
the numeric keypad (on the right of your keypad) into its row and
column!</p>
<p>Now, I'm willing to give them a pass for the "making change" problem,
since that involves finding the remainder after division. I don't know
why <em>why</em> I'm willing to forgive them for being unable to grasp a piece
of grade 5 math (I think), but I am. Maybe it's just because the numbers
can have four digits.</p>
<p>But the numeric keypad?!? Going from 7 =&gt; (0,0), 5 =&gt; (1,1), 1 =&gt; (2,0),
etc?! This is math on SINGLE DIGITS.</p>
<p>Hey, as an exercise, stop reading the blog and try to figure out the
forumlae. You need one to calculate the row number, and one to do the
column number. I'm really curious about whether you find it hard.</p>
<p>Go on, try it. I'll wait. Here's what the keypad looks like, in case
you're on a laptop and can't remember:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
7 8 9
4 5 6
1 2 3
</pre>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>If you want a hint, try subtracting 1 from the numeric keypad numbers,
so that you have numbers like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
6 7 8
3 4 5
0 1 2
</pre>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>Another hint? Well, the numbers in the left-most column are 6, 3, 0.
Those are all divisible by 3, giving us 2, 1, 0. In fact, if you divide
any number by three and round down, you'll get 2, 1, 0 (depending on
which row it's in).</p>
<p>But we want the reverse of those: 0, 1, 2. How can we get from 2, 1, 0
to 0, 1, 2?</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>Right, we just take 2-x. Putting this all together, we have:</p>
<blockquote>
row = 2 - (number-1)/3
(if we always round down the division by 3; the computer does that
automatically when we do arithmetic on integers)</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>Once we have the row number, subtracting three times that value from the
initial number gives us:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
0 1 2
0 1 2
0 1 2
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>So it's trivial to figure out what the column is. On the computer, we
can use the remainder ("%" -- it looks kind-of like a division slash
"/") operation:</p>
<blockquote>
row = (number-1)%3</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>I <em>really</em> didn't think that this was hard, but the kids were watching
me explain this like I was proving the central limit theorem or
something. This left me quite sad -- how badly can the high school
system fail students such that university-level children can't do this
kind of simple math?!?!</p>
<p>Anybody with experience teaching first-year students, or advanced high
school students: am I being unreasonable here? And do you have any tips
about how to get them comfortable with such math? Unfortunately, being
able to solve problems like this is rather critical to programming, but
this course is already pretty full as it is. I really don't think I can
afford to spend two weeks on "math thinking" exercises, even though
that's what they desperately need. :(</p>

<p>On the plus side, giving a lecture to them was <em>really</em> fun. It was in
one of the lecture theatres in the engineering building, which has real,
honest-to-goodness blackboards. Blackboards with decades of chalk
powdered onto them. I'm also not familiar with chalk (in the past, I've
always lectured from pdf slides or with a whiteboard), so I kept on
wiping my hands on my jeans or sweater. I was covered in chalk by the
end of the hour... it was just like being a kid and playing in the mud.
You know, when you get completely filthy and you know it'll take ages to
clean up, but you're having too much fun getting dirty to care? Just
like that, but instead of mud or snow, I was (figuratively) rolling
around in chalk.</p>
