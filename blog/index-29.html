<p>Report about my "tourist" time in Bordeaux. I'll be making later posts
about the technical material from my talk and the conference as a whole.
This post is just about tourist information, and is probably only of
interest to my immediate family and friends, who probably all shuddered
when they heard that I was going to Bordeaux, city of fine wines, fine
dining, and hot sunny weather.</p>
<p>Anyway, Bordeaux. I generally took no pictures (to conserve my
power-cable-less mobile phone alarm clock, but when we stumbled upon a
Botanical Gardens, I figured that I really had to take a few -- not that
the plants were <em>particularly</em> interesting, but because I seem to have
developed a habit of posting photo sets from gardens around the world.)</p>

<div class="section" id="friday">
<h2>Friday</h2>
<p>Met with John Mandereau (who I'd met on Thurs) and Valentin Villenave,
whose name is pronounced "Val-en-ton". Not that anybody from the UK can
justifiably complain about spelling vs. pronounciation of names.</p>
<p>We had lunch at the conference caferia: chicken (I didn't take), rice,
brocolli, mixed salad thing, and some raspberry pudding-thing. The mixed
salad thing and raspberry pudding-thing were fancier than I'd expect
from an English university cafeteria; the rice and brocolli were about
the same.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I gave my talk. More details about that later.</p>
<p>After the talk, we went to the casino (<em>un supermaché</em>, remember, not a
den of dubious mathematical ability) for some drinks. That sounds way
classier than "we went to the grocery store to get some bottles of warm
coke, because they were out of cold coke". We then went downtown, and I
saw some of the major sights (and sites) of the city -- the cathedral,
the grand theatre, and the longest pedestrian-only road in France or
Europe or something like that.</p>
<p>Of course, we also did something else. What do three guys in their late
20s / early 30s do when they're on vacation in a foreign city, far away
from anybody who might recognize them...? Yep, that's right -- we went
clothes shopping!</p>
<p>I had previously gone to two Primark stores (seems like the UK version
of Zellars, Walmart, etc) and been unable to find men's shorts without
hawaiian patterns on them. And I didn't look at the weather forcast for
Bordeaux until a day before I left... if I'd realized that it would be
35 C, I'd have made more of a priority for finding shorts, and maybe
even sandals. But I hadn't, so I didn't.</p>
<p>We found a mall and then checked out three different clothing stores,
and I tried on four pairs of shorts, before I found something
semi-decent. They were 25 € , which seemed like a complete rip-off (for
reference, my pants... err, "trousers"... were £6, and my t-shirts were
£2 each, and the exchange rate is less than 1.2 € per £1). But I was too
miserable in my long pants (err, trousers) to quibble.</p>
<p>To complete our de-male-ification, John bought a pair of shoes as well.
So in our first few hours of vacation in Bordeaux, we did everything
girly apart from ogling hot guys. If girls do that? I certainly know
that I was ogling hot girls... and in the entire time I was there, I
only saw 2 or 3 girls under the age of 40 who weren't "hot" by Glasgow
standards. French girls are really, really hot.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>We then went to a pizzeria for dinner. Apparently ham and pineapple is
an "<em>exotique</em>" pizza. The discussion rapidly became an examination of
modern community political parties. Dinner was followed by "a political
film", although we thought it was clumsily done. I don't mind films with
a Message (with a capital 'M'), but only as long as the Message is
delivered well. This one wasn't. It felt like the film was preaching to
the choir, and tried to throw in a few questionable things to make the
whole thing "edgy". Oh, but I discovered that French cinemas have really
comfortable chairs. Padded red velvet things... way better than Canadian
cinemas.</p>
<p>The film was supposed to be followed by a "discussion", but we left as
soon as it was over. We then spent an hour walking around in a circle
(not in the mathematical "an infinite series of points which are
equidistant from one central point", but in an "we returned to the
starting point") looking for a bar. At that point, John declared himself
in charge, and found a bar which was 30 seconds away from our
starting/ending point (which was a tram station).</p>
<p>Oh yeah, the main transport (at least for us) were trams. These travel
at something like 20 km/h... faster than I could run, but nowhere near
the speed of subway trains.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="saturday">
<h2>Saturday</h2>
<p>Went to "grande public" version of the conference: a few large tents by
the river, filled with booths. Nothing that I hadn't seen at the main
"technical" conference. But there we met up with Nicolas Sceaux, scheme
programmer extrodinaire.</p>
<p>Ate a on a cafe terrace; we all had <em>le plat du jour</em>. The first course
was a seafood pastry; the main course was pork, vegetables, and rice;
the dessert was chocolat mousse; the meal also included some
after-dinner coffee. But this description completely misses the elegance
of the presentation, the style of cooking (no clue), the spices used
(dunno), the types of vegetables (don't even know that), the reason why
the rice was yellow (herbs?), etc. Basically: it was a real French meal
at a real French cafe in a real French trendy district of a real French
city.</p>
<p>I expected to feel completely awkward and out of place, but it was
actually ok.</p>
<p>We were waiting for a friend to finish meeting with his grandparents, so
we went to a bookstore so that I could look at French <em>bande dessinée</em>
(graphic novels) -- I knew that they had a tradition of such things, and
I was curious as to whether there was any simularity to Japanese manga.
(there wasn't)</p>
<p>We then gave up on the friend and tried to drive to the beach, but
encountered some insane traffic jams and turned back. While we were
returning to town, the friend phone up, so we met for pre-dinner drinks
at another outdoor cafe. More politics was discussed.</p>
<p>The evening meal was <em>crépes</em>, which were fantastic. These are thin
pancakes, folded to make a vaguely envelope-shaped thing, with some kind
of filling inside -- ham and cheese, salmon, vegetarian paté, etc. I had
the vegetarian one for the main course, and a caramel <em>crépe</em> for
dessert. It was incredibly good.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sunday">
<h2>Sunday</h2>
<p>We saw John off to the train station, then Valentin and I went to the
botanical gardens. That was followed by boxed sandwiches from a
supermarket, eaten in the park next to the gardens. Academic politics
was discussed.</p>
<p>After lunch, we rented some bikes, which was a fantastic idea. Bordeaux
(and, according to Valentin, most major French cities) have rental bikes
along the side of the road. You use a credit card (or maybe debit card?)
to put down a deposit, then rent the bike for 1 or 2 Euro an hour. We
zoomed along the riverside, then went up to the lake. After we arrived
at the lake beach, I remembered that French beaches were (in)famous for
certain things. We didn't stay long, though, and went back to the city.</p>
<p>Saw some tower/arch thing (famous gate to the city, lookout point, or
something), saw some archeological dig of Christian graves from the 1st
to 7th centuries (fun fact: the French word for "Christianity" is
"Chretien", which is the name of one of the Canadian prime ministers...
every time the tour guide said that word, I thought about politics), saw
a church that was every bit as fancy as a cathedral (albeit not as
large).</p>
<p>We wandered around for an hour looking for a good place for dinner that
wasn't too expensive without finding anything (my friend: "it's
Bordeaux! They don't know about `not expensive'" -- although since he
was from Paris, I'm not certain that he actually knows about living
cheaply). Inspired by a desire to be horrible, we ended up having dinner
at a Subway.</p>
<p>It wasn't great. They didn't have the selection of bread that UK Subways
have, they didn't have as many sauces (although I <em>did</em> discover that
southwest sauce is pretty good on an Italian BMT), and the lettuce
looked a bit suspect (the store was quite warm). However, it <em>did</em>
provide nourishment, and it wasn't expensive. Also, it's certain to
horrify anybody who reads this blog post. :)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="monday">
<h2>Monday</h2>
<p>We went to see a mall, since they were all closed on Sunday. I was
curious about daily life, and I'd already seen the streets and
transport.</p>
<p>It was pretty much the same as malls in Canada, the UK, and Singapore.
Maybe slightly more perfume stores and chocolate/sweet stores than in
the other countries, but I wouldn't immediately say that it was a
statistically significant difference. We went to a large department
store as well... it had much more <em>bande designée</em> than I was expecting,
but other than that it was pretty much like such stores in Canada and
Singapore. (I haven't been to such a store in the UK)</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>Got a city bus to the airport; that was fine. Bordeaux Airport doesn't
have quick check-in machines... at every other airport I've been to, if
you only have hand baggage, you can use a computer to check in and get
your boarding pass. But over here, I had to line up with all the people
putting baggage in the cargo bay. Ick. :(</p>
<p>I did sudoku puzzles for all the flight.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>Back in London Gatwick, I kept on getting thrown by people speaking
English. I mean, I'd gotten used to rehearsing a sentence a few times
and having difficulty understanding what people were saying... but now
suddenly, I speak the native language!</p>
<p>There was yet another switch coming in the departure lounge at Gatwick
airpot -- the serving staff at the restaurant I stopped at (to get a
burger; this wasn't a fancy French restaurant) spoke French between
themselves, so I found myself ordering and asking for the bill in
French. So much for the "back in Britain" bit!</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>I really regret not doing any language preparation... even something as
basic as listening to half a dozen podcasts would have done a lot to
re-tune my mind for the language and remind myself of some vocabulary.
Oh well; next time!</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>And now for the two questions you've all been waiting for. Was I scared
of people thinking that I was an American and wimped out by carring a
Canadian flag around with me? Yes; it took me less than 6 hours. I had a
luggage tag with a big Canadian flag; I removed that from my suitcase
and attached it to my handbag.</p>
<p>And the second question: do I have the most incredible tan lines that
I've ever had in my life? Yes. The difference between my lower arms and
upper arms (much less my stomach) is unbelievable. I didn't deliberately
seek out the sun, of course... but apparently if you're walking around
in a sunny city all day, you still get sunburned. Huh.</p>
<p>(I'm happy to report that my £1 sunglasses and £2 sun-hat did an
excellent job of protecting my eyes and face.)</p>

<p>I'm now in Bordeaux for <a class="reference external" href="http://rmll.info">Rencontres Mondiales du Logiciel
Libre</a>, or the Libre Software Meeting. Before I
left, I was frantically finishing other tasks before this trip, so this
is the least prepared trip I've ever made. A few shocks ensured.</p>
<p>First, I should clarify that I generally over-plan, so "the least
prepared trip" doesn't necessarily say a lot. I mean, before I moved to
Singapore, I used google maps to find the nearest pizza hut, McDonalds,
and Burger King to my accommodation. I knew that I wouldn't want to
think about where to eat on my first day there.</p>
<p>Anyway, I got up at 7:01, packed, and left my residence at 7:21. I'd
decided to try taking the 747 "air bus" instead of a taxi, so I was at
the bus stop at 7:35 for a bus that arrived at 7:50. Arrived at the
airport at 8:24, done with security at 9:02, and my flight left at
10:00. I forgot to power off the wireless on my laptop, so I left the
laptop turned off for the flight to London.</p>
<p>London Gatwick international terminal is a dump. I couldn't see any
power sockets available other than the ones for the "internet station".
I was also disappointed by the lack of cheap hamburgers -- the only
place that seemed to sell them was a sit-down restaurant. I ended up
having a pair of sandwiches from a box. This becomes relevant later on.</p>
<p>Flight to Bordeaux was mostly uneventful -- I happened to look down just
as we reached the France coast, which was neat scenery. Oh, and halfway
through the flight, there was an announcement of the local time in
Bordeaux -- apparently France is one hour ahead! WTM, they're directly
south of the UK. Why would the time zone be different?! WTM*2, the fact
that I didn't know this already is a bad sign. The next surprise came as
I was walking through the airport towards the taxis -- everybody was
speaking French!</p>
<p>Ok, I need to explain that part. Yes, I knew that people in France spoke
French. But (for no reason) I was kind-of expecting it to be like
Montreal... yeah, it's a French city, but you still hear tons of
English. In contrast, I really stressed out about Singapore (even though
English is one of the official languages, I knew that most people were
primarily Chinese-speaking), but that was way better than I feared. By
contrast, I hadn't thought about the France trip at all, and this part
didn't live up to my unexpectations.</p>
<p>I also realized that this was the first time that I'd been in a country
in which I didn't speak any official language(s). (yes, I visited France
and Italy in a high school trip... but we had a tour guide and teachers
for that. Besides, I was 17, so that doesn't count for anything)</p>
<p>I haven't really tried to speak French in the intermediate 14 years, and
it went worse than I imagined -- in almost all cases, I resorted to
speaking English, which made me a rather lame tourist-person, rather
than an up-and-coming global academic. :(</p>
<p>It doesn't help that I keep on thinking of Japanese words for things but
can't remember the French ones. That's completely reasonable, given the
amount of time I've spent learning and listening to Japanese over the
past few years... but not as all helpful when trying to communicate in
this part of the world. :|</p>
<p>Part of the problem is that people seemed to assume that I'd be speaking
French. Growing up in Vancouver, you find that people speak English
fluently and/or have an obvious cultural background which indicates that
English might not be their native language. Sure, I'm terrible at
recognizing the difference between Chinese and Korean people... but when
you see somebody of Asian background, you know that they might not speak
English as a first language. However, whenever you see any Caucasian in
Vancouver, you can safely assume that they speak English fluently. I
found the same thing in Singapore... even if they were actually German
or whatnot, they spoke English fluently.</p>
<p>To make matters even more confusing, I seem to (visually) fit in more
with people here than I do in Glasgow. Maybe it's just because I haven't
found a large group of computer geeks in Glasgow yet, but I really don't
look Scottish. I find it quite believable that I look "French enough"
that people here are unpleasantly surprised when I can't say simple
sentences in French and ask if they can speak English. (as least I ask
that in French)</p>
<p>Being the cause of language difficulties is a rather humbling
experience.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>Anyway, I managed to sort out my room and internet access (not at the
same place, but I don't mind walking a few minutes to send emails), then
looked around for dinner. I ended up going to a casino.</p>
<p>What?! Sweet little Graham has been corrupted into drinking and gambling
by those degenerate French...!? well, no. Apparently there's a
supermarket chain here called "Casino". I bought a 6-pack of bottled
water, a diet coke, and two boxes of sandwiches. Yes, my first meal in
Bordeaux -- famed for fine wines, fine dining, etc. -- was a boxed
sandwich and a semi-chilled diet coke. (the other sandwich is for later
this evening)</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>I'm not being <em>totally</em> lame here... at least, I don't think I am. I'm
exhausted by travelling (I am <em>not</em> a good traveller), short on sleep,
and still need to finish half the slides for my talk on Friday. A quiet
dinner, an hour or two of editing, and an early sleep is just what I
need so that I can enjoy the rest of the conference.</p>
<p>Let's see, what else... oh yeah, my room! It really reminds me of
Shaunigahn (sp) Lake. Now, that means nothing to everyone but my family
and 1 or 2 readers, so I'll elaborate: my family is highly involved in
the West Coast Amateur Musician Society summer music camp, which used to
be on Vancouver Island at a boarding school next to Shaunigahn Lake.
So... not the best quality, but certainly good enough for a couple of
days. Oh, except that instead of having open showers (like summer camp
15 years ago), these ones have separate stalls. The atmosphere is also
much more like that music camp than an academic conference... which
makes sense, since this <em>isn't</em> an academic conference. :)</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>The final touch: despite the language, Bordeaux actually feels more like
Canada than Glasgow does. There's <em>space</em> here! I mean, buildings are
separate -- light filters through the spaces between buildings. And
buildings are different -- it's not all the same brick or sandstone
imitation brick. The dodgy-looking businesses are in awful off-yellow
buildings. The fancy places look fancy. The malls look like parking
lots, with something glassy and shiny off in the distance.</p>
<p>Ok, probably if I went to Bordeaux city center, I'd see the same type of
architecture as in Glasgow city center. But I've seen small towns and
the outskirts of big cities in the UK, and this place is <em>much</em> more
Canadian than those places.</p>
<hr class="docutils">
<p>PS: I brought my cell phone charger so that I wouldn't have to worry
about running out of power and could take pictures without concern...
but on the first plane trip, I realized that, although I had a set of
"worldwide plug adaptors", those adaptors were for North American plugs.
My laptop is just fine, but not the cell phone. Sorry! (but really, you
didn't want to see blurry cell phone pictures in the first place)</p>

    <div>
<p>I've written a quick test of key presses and mouse clicks in flash --
does your computer lose any?</p>
<p>We were doing some final (?) testing of my tempo-detection flash game on
my mother's computer, but discovered that the computer was failing to
detect some key presses. After a bit more testing, I decided it was
unlikely that it was a hardware problem. So either my Mom's version of
flash can lose some keypresses, or there's something wrong with my
program.</p>
<p>I made a simple test that just prints out info for each key press or
mouse click. It's mainly so that we can test it on my mother's computer,
but I'm including it here in case anybody else feels like being nice and
wouldn't mind testing it a bit. :)</p>
<p>The object: tap a key a set number of times. Check if the computer has
detected the right number. You could do this by picking a number like 20
and just start tapping... or you could pick a rhythm-saying (like "shave
and a haircut, two bits" -- that's 7 taps) and repeating that a few
times.</p>
<p>If you discover that the computer's count of the taps doesn't match what
you think you did, I'd really like to hear about this. It's possible
that something's just wonky on my mom's computer, and that I don't need
to scrap this whole research project. However, it's also possible that a
typical flash installation doesn't reliably detect key presses. This
would cause great problems for me, of course, but knowing about the
problem would be better than not knowing about it.</p>
<p>If you discover some missing key presses, please try it with the mouse
-- if the mouse is more reliable than the keyboard, I can still go ahead
with this (albeit with a few changes).</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>PS: I'm not finding any blog or forum posts complaining about the
reliability of key events in flash, so it might be something weird in my
game after all. The real test is to find out if this simple test works
on a computer that couldn't handle the actual game, of course.</p>
<hr class="docutils">
<p><strong>Later edit:</strong> Apparently the keys are reliable when I compile my
project for flash 10 instead of flash 9. Maybe the additional
optimizations in 10 help? Anyway, things seem to be working now.</p>
