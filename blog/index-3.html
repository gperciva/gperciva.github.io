<p>My father is fond of telling people that he used to work at SIN
(Schweizerisches Institut fur Nuklearphysik). Well, I'm surpassing him
-- I don't need to work at it. I'm just going to SIN. Jan 5 to May 28.</p>
<p>Hmm. It's approximately 30 km from the airport to the university. If I
keep on running through the winter, I could probably run that distance
by the time I go there.</p>

<p>I have the first test version of the MEAWS rhythm game written in Flash.
It was much easier than I expected; if this actually works, I'm going to
be disgusted.</p>
<p>If you're reasonably computer-savvy and/or don't mind wasting a few
minutes, try it: <a class="reference external" href="http://percival-music.ca/test.html">rhythm test</a>.</p>
<p>You need a microphone. The object is to discover if this is actually a
viable cross-platform tool. There is (virtually) no user interface, no
game, and no fun. You'll probably need to try running it a few times
before you get anything happening. To try it again, hit "refresh".</p>

<p>I received the teaching evaluations for last summer. UVic, like I
imagine most universities these days, asks students to fill out an
evaluation form about their instructors and TAs near the end of the
class. These include a numerical portion (giving a ranking from -2 to +2
on things like "use relevant examples and illustrations" or "is polite,
courteous and provides an open, hospitable environment for all") and
comments.</p>
<p>The numerical section tends to be useless -- I've filled out enough of
them myself to know that the answers can be fairly random -- but I
always pay attention to the written comments. (these can be typed out by
a secretary to anonymize the handwriting if the student ticks the
relevant box).</p>
<p>I recieved the best two comments in my (teaching) life this time. The
second-best comment was</p>
<blockquote>
He has a great abillity [sic] to explain in may different ways.</blockquote>
<p>I make a deliberate effort to do this, so I'm quite happy that somebody
noticed. If somebody doesn't understand a concept, I'll repeat the same
explanation once (in case he wasn't paying attention the first time --
quite reasonable in a lab setting). But if they still don't get it, I
try to find a radically different way to explain the concept.</p>
<p>The best comment of all was:</p>
<blockquote>
... and he has the greatest eye's [sic] I have ever seen.</blockquote>
<p>Once of my fellow grad students at UVic was really pleased about getting
"The prof is smoking hot", and now I understand why. Quite apart from
the mundane physical compliment, it indicates a level of friendly
respect. I mean, nobody would ever write "the instructor was a complete
jerk, was always unprepared, couldn't teach anything... but had fabulous
hair". When students throw in comments like that, you know that they're
happy.</p>
<p>I must admit that the grammar adds a certain naive charm. This was a
first-year class, so it seems entirely appropriate to have a "look out,
there's an S coming!" apostrophe in there. :)</p>
