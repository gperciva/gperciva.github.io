<p>I have a daughter now! Ok, by "daughter", I mean "a computer program
which plays violin at approximately the level of a student with one year
of experience". But hey, that's the closest that I'm likely to get to
having children of my own!</p>
<p>You can read about "Vivi, the virtual violinist" on my revised website:
<a class="reference external" href="http://percival-music.ca/vivi.html">http://percival-music.ca/vivi.html</a></p>
<p>I should have said everything that needs to be said on the website, so I
won't blather on about her right now.</p>
<p>Oh, the name? Well, "<strong>Vi</strong>rtual <strong>Vi</strong>olinist" is pretty obvious.
But also because I created her with the <strong>vi</strong> text editor. And she
plays music created by <em>Lily</em>pond. All in all, I thought that <em>Vivi</em>
was a great name for her! BTW, for any non-English speakers -- "Vivi"
rhymes with "Lily".</p>

<p>My apologies for not uploading the Artifastring 1.2 announcement until
just now -- it was waiting in my "beta" queue, but I forgot to run the
final "upload" command.</p>
<p>Also apologies for my sheet music not being accessible on the new
website yet. I'm in such a rush to show off Vivi that I left a few
"rough edges" on the new website. I'll fix them over the next week. :)</p>

<p>I'm happy to announce the release of Artifastring 1.2, a highly
optimized physical simulation of a violin for sound synthesis.
<a class="reference external" href="http://percival-music.ca/artifastring/">http://percival-music.ca/artifastring/</a></p>
<p>This release has a few minor cleanups, but much more importantly, it has
updated values for some physical constants! Matthias Demoucron, the
author of the PhD thesis which describes the algorithm used in
Artifastring, was kind enough to reply to my questions and provide some
additional information.</p>
<p>Some example files are in the <tt class="docutils literal">music/</tt> directory; if you have no clue
what kind of physical values might produce decent sounds, try looking in
there. The resulting audio will not sound like a professional violinist,
but it should be enough to give you a rough idea and get started.</p>
<p>Note, however, that those files are for a purely mechanical reproduction
of actions; my actual "teaching a computer to play violin" work is not
part of Artifastring itself. Due to my personal vacation plans (I only
get to see my family once a year!), I've decided to submit papers to the
Sound and Music Conference instead of the International Computer Music
Conference. This will let me spend more time in Vancouver. :)</p>
<p>I should be posting updated examples for the violin playing (rather than
the physical simulation code) later this week. I might even do a
"screen-cast" and produce a video! If I don't post anything by Friday,
then I'm probably making a video and fumbling through a bunch of
unfamiliar software.</p>

<p>I've been teaching my computer how to play violin for the past month or
so. I'm quite happy with the results, but bear in mind -- I'm a cello
and viola teacher. I know what beginners sound like. Those professional
string quartets you listen to in the car? There's more than 50 years of
training between those four people.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm happy with the progress, but I expect that most listeners
will be distinctly underwhelmed. That's fine; this isn't the final
version. I'm mainly making a status update for my family.</p>
<p>The overall task I've set myself is to perform a piece of sheet music on
<a class="reference external" href="http://percival-music.ca/artifastring/">Artifastring</a> (my physical
violin model). In other words, given music like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<img alt="a two-octave G major scale with some staccato and slurs" src="http://percival-music.ca/blogfiles/scale.preview.png">
</blockquote>
<p>produce a sound file something like this:
<a class="reference external" href="http://percival-music.ca/blogfiles/scale.wav.mp3">scale.wav.mp3</a>
with no human intervention. Previous training is allowed, but the
computer must produce music based on the sheet music.</p>
<p>In case you're wondering, that was completely "artificial" rather than
recorded music. My computer program(s) looked at the music, figured out
what physical actions would be required to produce the sounds, began
synthesizing the sound with Artifastring, and adjusted the physical
actions based on qualities of the sound.</p>
<p>I reached this stage less than a week ago, so I'm still working out
major things. I got slurs working for the first time a few hours ago,
and certain major things (like dynamics) are completely ignored at the
moment. But it certainly feels great to be looking at some sheet music
and listening to my baby playing violin. :)</p>
<p>I've been working on the scale for past two days, so that's the most
"impressive" thing I have. I have some earlier works:</p>
<blockquote>
<a class="reference external" href="http://percival-music.ca/blogfiles/jingle.wav.mp3">Jingle bells</a>
<a class="reference external" href="http://percival-music.ca/blogfiles/twinkle.wav.mp3">Twinkle twinkle little star (student
version)</a>
</blockquote>
<p>The "student version" was deliberately made out of tune, because I
thought it would be cute. It certainly brings tears to my eyes!
Unfortunately the rhythm is still perfect; I need to program my computer
to deliberately screw up the rhythm in order to really imitate a
beginning violinist.</p>
<p>Now that I've finally reached the stage of actual musical training
(instead of lurking around in the depths of marsyas and academic papers
on nonlinear control theory), I'm hopeful that I can force myself to
only spend 1 hour a day on this (just like a real violin student), and
get back to my human-oritented educational software.</p>
