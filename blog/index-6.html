<p>The next version MEWER is online. The difficulty level has been
calibrated[1], and I've added a third variant of MEWER. This new variant
includes an audible metronome! However, the metronome is quite
unreliable. If it works on your computer, great; if not, don't say I
didn't warn you. Try it here: <a class="reference external" href="http://percival-music.ca/software/mewer/index.html">MEWER
0.9</a>.</p>
<p>I still think MEWER is now feature-complete for 1.0 -- I'm not planning
on adding any more features; merely fixing any bugs people find.</p>
<p>[1] My preferred calibration method was to have four glasses of wine and
then play the game on "easy". I figured that I'd keep on reducing the
difficulty level until I could finish the game while drunk; that would
probably be an appropriate level for students with one year of musical
training.</p>
<p>But then I remembered that I don't drink alcohol, so I had to abandon my
"drunken rhythm game" test. Instead, I started watching some bad anime,
and played the game with my attention split between the anime and the
game. I finished "easy" with no difficulty. Calibration for the "hard"
difficulty level was performed by playing the game without any
distractions.</p>
<p>This isn't an ideal scientific calibration, of course -- I should really
be doing some kind of double-blind study on dozens of music students of
various ability levels -- but I can't do that kind of experiment until
MEWER is much more widely used.</p>

<p>The next version MEWER is online. This adds a "skip to level" option (if
you want to practice triplets, or just see what the harder levels are
like), and misc minor UI improvements. Try it here: <a class="reference external" href="http://percival-music.ca/software/mewer/index.html">MEWER
0.8</a>.</p>

<p>The next version MEWER is online. This adds a main menu, Tutorial, Tips,
and (for flash) Input select functions. Try it here: <a class="reference external" href="http://percival-music.ca/software/mewer/index.html">MEWER
0.7</a>.</p>
<p>I'm not certain what this leaves. I have mixed feelings about changing
to a non-sequential series of levels... I mean, yes, it's a good idea.
But I think it would involve more work than I have time for at the
moment. It certainly isn't something necessary for version 1.0. Right
now I want to check for anything important missing (like typos in the
tutorial explanation, or missing info) before declaring it 1.0 and
advertizing it to more people.</p>
