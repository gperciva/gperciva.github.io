<p>I'm now competent at getting around in Singapore, have a grown-up email
address (<tt class="docutils literal">percival@location</tt> -- previously only my father has one of
those!), and have my employment pass.</p>
<p>Getting the MRT (their version of skytrain, which is Vancouver's
mostly-above-ground subway) was ok. I made trips to a few electronic
ticket booths before finding out that I was to buy the EZ pass (prepaid
debit card system for transit) at the counter.</p>
<p>I then might have committed my first cultural blunder. There was an
escalator that was crowded, and stairs that were unused. I assumed that
everybody was being lazy and went up the stairs, but when I was almost
at the top I noticed an "exit" sign. There wasn't a "do not enter" sign
at the bottom (I think -- I'll have to check on my way home). And I
haven't noticed any distinction (other than running escalators) in other
stations. I felt a bit conspicuous, though.</p>
<p>Got to NUS, but couldn't reach my supervisor's office -- it was behind a
keycarded area. I hung out in front of the door for a few minutes,
trying to see if I could send him an email (I couldn't), and a girl (or
woman) came along. I asked her to knock on his door, but she just let me
into the area and I made my way to his office and met him.</p>
<p>He was suprised to see me so early; he'd told me that I should be
well-rested for my first day in Singapore and we didn't have to meet
until 11 or so, but since I woke up early I figured there was no point
not going. We then chatted a bit and then saw the HR person for advice
on which formalities should be done next. Unfortunately the answer was
"get the employment pass", so I headed off downtown to visit the
Ministry Of Manpower. And yes, they do actually abbreviate it as MOM.</p>
<p>When I arrived and got my ticket, they were processing number 265. I was
404. That's not quite as bad as it sounds, though -- in the first 10
minutes, they handled 25 numbers. Later on I estimated that they'd done
60-70 in half an hour.</p>
<p>What is as bad as it sounds is that after receiving my documents, they
took them off to be processed. Come back in 3 hours. I wondered whether
to transit back to NUS, but it was two MRT lines and a bus ride, so I
opted to wander around in downtown Singapore.</p>
<p>Ravenous for food, I started looking for some. I ended up in the food
court in the main mall in Chinatown, whereupon I... well, I'm sure you
can all guess. I left as soon as possible and wandered in the direction
that seemed most likely to get me Western food.</p>
<p>Yes, I know that I'll be unable to survive in Singapore if I don't try
other foods, and yes, I should have done more preparing. I was actually
intending to suggest Asian take-out whenever my friends got together to
watch anime, but that hasn't happened sinnce... I don't know. September?
July?</p>
<p>Anyway, there's a time to try new food, and a time to stick with what
you know. On a day like today, you stick with what you know.</p>
<p>After about 30 minutes of walking in the insane heat and sun, I saw a
7-11. I considered going there and getting whatever they had (warmed-up
hot dog, maybe? I don't know what they have in 7-11s here), but it was
on the other side of a major street and there weren't any cross-walks
around. So I kept on walking, and saw a KFC in the distance.</p>
<p>Just as I was about to enter the KFC, I noticed a sign for Subway on a
bus stop. It was pointing towards the building, and I then noticed a
mall entrance beside the KFC. Inside the "electric town" mall, I found
the subway. Which was good, because I had been seriously considering
asking somebody for directions. Now, that might not sound so terrible,
but I'd have asked for "Western food", not just "food". I don't know
quite where that ranks in the list of stupid American tricks, but it's
got to be in there somewhere.</p>
<p>On way back from that mall, I noticed other Subway store and Western
food that I'd missed -- mere meters away from the MRT station I left. I
spent a good deal of time walking through that mall ("Central mall"),
which seemed to be aimed at tourists.</p>
<p>At MOM again, I was 470 and they were processing 380. I waited for
another 60 minutes in the queue. I don't know why we couldn't pay when
we drop off our passports and whatnot. The pickup would take a minute!
Come to think of it, even though we had to pay, I still don't know why
it took some people longer than a minute. I mean, I handed over my
ticket number, my old ticket number, and S$100 in cash. The clerk gave
me back S$50 and told me it was only S$30, fetched my bundle, and gave
me another S$20. Literally over in 60 seconds!</p>
<p>It was 4:40pm at that time, and I'm still jetlagged, so I went straight
home. I've got the wireless working now (the magic words were
"wep_key0", which do not appear anywhere in the man page for
wpa_supplicant. Looking up help online for how to connect to the
internet is one of the most frustrating things. Especially in this case,
where I knew it would take at most 3 minutes... oh well. Got it working
now.</p>
<p>What I don't have working is email. After trying to send email a few
times from both NUS and my apartment, I realized that my computer was
still set up to use shaw's smtp server. No wonder it was dying! However,
I haven't found any info about smtp servers here yet.</p>

<p>Room description without pictures. Pictures are not a priority and will
happen later.</p>
<p>First impression: sweet mao this is huge!</p>
<p>At the door, I paused to take my shoes off, but the manager told me not
to bother. That surprised me -- I thought all Asian cultures were very
down on shoes inside -- but she's the boss.</p>
<p>My personal room is bigger than my old bedroom at home. It's over twice
as big as my room in Victoria. This really surprises me -- I've heard so
much about the density of cities in Asia, and I read somewhere that
Singapore was either the densest (sp) or second-densest country in the
world. But I guess that once you start going vertical in a big way, you
get a lot of "extra" space. My room is on the 8th floor of 15, by the
way.</p>
<p>In some ways the room (not just my bedroom, but also the dining area and
living area) are too big. They look quite sparse. Sounds seem to echo a
lot and I felt like I was being really noisy when I was moving around at
2am, but apparently it didn't wake up anybody.</p>
<p>Went to sleep at about 3am, woke up at 7am. That's 3pm in the afternoon
by Vancouver time, which seems reasonable as a continuation of my
26-hour sleep cycle.</p>
<p>I think the room is facing east. There was certainly a lot of sun.
Remember that Singapore is basically on the equator, so sunrise/sunset
is pretty stable at 7am/7pm. There's a lot of traffic on the street
outside -- maybe a bit more than Canada Way (at home). Maybe the idea of
being up at 9am every day will be easy!</p>
<p>Looking out the window, I was struck by the first time I wanted to use
the term "riot of colours". The railing on my private balcony is light
blue -- I hadn't noticed that at night. There's massive amounts of green
on the sides of the road and surrounding the lake. I've commented in the
past that my (old) area in Victoria makes Vancouver look pathetic; this
place gives Victoria a run for its money. There's areas of bright red
bricks on the road. Admittedly the lake isn't a nice brilliant blue. I
think I'd rather swim in Burnaby Lake than this one.</p>
<p>Now for the comparison with my parents:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Bringing sheets: Dad was half-right. The mattress has a sheet (ground
sheet? bed sheet? What are they called?), but no upper sheet. I got a
blanket (as expected), but I'm not certain if I'd use it.
When I arrived at the room, I was going to take off another mark from
Dad on this one since I wouldn't need a sheet, but it felt too weird
to try to go to sleep without any cover.
I didn't think about what "30 degrees C" meant. Remember those days
in the summer where you feel overdressed while naked? It's like that
here all the time.</li>
<li>Pillow: Mom was wrong, I got a pillow.</li>
<li>Slippers: Dad was right, those were extremely useful on the flight,
and I think I'll wear them around the apartment.</li>
<li>Kimono (or whatever the male equivalent is, if that's the female
one): my parents were right; my lack of one is distressing. Oh yeah,
if anybody has suggestions for what type of Asian light wear I should
get, please let me know. As you can tell, I don't know the basics of
what the clothing is called or what gender they're for.</li>
<li>Sweaters: Mom was wrong; I don't need any sweaters. The
air-conditioned areas are still 21 - 23 C, which is emminently
T-shirt conditions.</li>
</ul>

<p>In summary, the room is much nicer than I expected.</p>

<p>Ok, I'm here now.</p>
<p>The first flight was very nice. It was a Boeing 777-300, and it had LCD
displays on the back of every seat, and power sockets on most seats
(including mine -- I chose my seat for that reason). This means that I
can use my laptop for the 13-hour 45-minute flight. :)</p>
<p>I've decided to do this blog post piecemeal; I'm writing stuff as it
occurs to me. That's easier than trying to remember everything at the
end. I'll probably be switching between present and past tense, though.
It's currently one hour into the flight.</p>
<p>At 4 hours, I'm listening to current French pop songs. It seems that as
long as I can't understand the lyrics, I enjoy popular music a lot more.
(yes, I can speak French, but picking out lyrics in the middle of a song
is beyond me, especially when I'm deliberately not trying to listen.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately all is not sweets and roses on this flight. The LCD is
nice, but a number of features -- include the "Map" menu -- are not
functioning. The error message is polite, but I wanted to see where we
were on the map, how far we'd travelled to date, etc.</p>
<p>7 hours now. I don't feel too bad, which is good 'cause it's only half
over. The thin slippers that Dad brought back from Japan (they was an
omake for some first-class train tickets) help a lot. They're coming
around with hot beverages, which will be followed by dinner. There's
still one more meal coming; 2 hours before the end, they give out hot
noodles. I've never been on a flight with three meals and six or seven
drinks before... but then again, I've never been on a 13.75 hour flight.
I was surprised by the amount of localization. Hot drinks include green
tea, and the standard chicken hot lunch meal came with chopsticks. I'm
not surprised because this doesn't make sense; I'm just surprised that
the business is flexible enough to have different meals on different
international flights.</p>
<p>I underestimated the amount of suckage involved in working on an
airplane -- and the amount that I normally fidget. It's not unusual for
me to have a foot on my desk, for example. Not in the classic "fat cat"
pose, though. My laptop is on the desk like normal, and I kind-of slouch
sideways. With one leg contorted around. Anyway, as of 12 hours, I've
gotten about 5 hours of work done. Spent 5 hours watching movies/TV
shows and/or eating, and about 2 hours of snoozing.</p>
<p>Hong Kong airport wasn't fun, since the first flight was delayed and
they had poor signage. Seriously, who names the international tranfer
flight check-in area "W1"? Also, either Air Canada shouldn't have
printed my second boarding pass, or the security guard should have
accepted it and not made me jog off to get a new one printed. I entered
the security line-up at the time I was supposed to be at the gate for
boarding. But after a bit more jogging, I arrived on the second plane.</p>
<p>The second flight was uninteresting in terms of airplane model (IIRC it
was a 777), food, entertainment, lack of sights (pitch black and me not
near a window anyway). I dozed for a bit.</p>
<p>Singapore airport was a model of efficiency; within 20 minutes of
stepping out of the airplane, I was stepping out of the airport. The
customs girl was very nice and smiled at me as I stuttered through my
explanation of my job (she had previously asked when I was starting my
studies, since I look so much like a student). She waved away my attempt
to show her my exiting flight (you're required to show proof of the next
destination if they ask).</p>
<p>The baggage carousel was actually the most nerve-wracking part. In the
future, I think I might get some yellow paint and draw a huge happy face
on the suitcase or something... there were just too many black
suitcases.</p>
<p>Of course, the airport experience might be quite different if I hadn't
arrived at midnight with nothing else arriving. Then again, my
supervisor (the one here, not my old supevisor) says that he's travelled
in over 40 countries, and the Singapore airport is the best.</p>
<p>Taxi ride was ok. A woman on the flight in said that it would be "really
really expensive... like S$30" and tried to think of other ways I could
get to my apartment, but in the end agreed that since the MRT was closed
and there probably wasn't a direct bus, it wasn't worth it. The taxi
ended up being S$40.20, but the driver gave me S$10 back when I handed
him a S$50 and waved off my apologies for not having any coins. I
figured that S$40 wasn't bad for a 35-minute drive mostly exceeding
100km/h. I definitely couldn't get a deal like that in Vancouver!</p>
<p>Impressions of the city at night: looked like any metropolist in North
America. There's a huge port, lots of construction, big skyscrapers.</p>
<p>First impression upon stepping out of the taxi: sweet mao it's hot. And
it's past midnight!</p>
<p>There wasn't anybody around when I arrived at my apartment, but the
security was very nice and friendly, and called up the manager. She came
down after five minutes, and was very friendly and got me checked in. I
got the info for wireless, but my computer wasn't set up to deal with
their particular encryption scheme (WEP), so I'm still just typing this
and will send tomorrow from the university.</p>
<p>Arrival at room, 1:30am. I spent an hour writing blog posts, emails, and
attempting to get the wireless working.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>Overall impression: Singaporeans are extremely nice and helpful. The
manager didn't show any signs of minding being woken up at 1am (she
thought I was arriving tomorrow), the security guy didn't give me any
glares for not knowing what I was doing, the only reactions to my braid
(that I detected) was occasional mild curiosity, and the customs agent
didn't transform into a tentacle monster and rip apart my paperwork and
suitcases.</p>
