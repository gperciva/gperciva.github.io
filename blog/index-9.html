<p>Things are settling into daily life.</p>
<p>University classes started this past Monday, so suddenly the campus is
busy and there's lineups at the food places at lunch. We've never had a
problem finding somewhere to sit, though. Sometimes it's the whole group
going together (including the professor); other times it's just three or
four people.</p>
<p>I continue to try different foods. This evening I had a Chinese
pancake-cheese-peanut creation. The picture looked vaguely like pizza,
but it turned out to be more of a snack/desert-type thing. I think the
chopped-peanut topping had sugar in it.</p>
<p>Of course, if I want pizza imitation without paying eight times the
normal price for a meal, I get Indian cheese naan bread with some kind
of hot red sauce. That was unexpectedly good, although I had to wait for
a while for them to cook it. I'm not certain if I'll go back there...
maybe when I'm on my own. I feel awkward joining the meal table when
everybody else is halfway finished.</p>
<p>Breakfast today -- at noon -- was Thai fried rice. I was told that it
was vegetarian, but it came with a few shrimps or prawns on the top. I
scraped those off onto another person's plate.</p>
<p>I'm not really certain what to do about breakfast. I like arriving at
the lab before other people, but that means that I skip breakfast to get
there. I'm also not starving in the mornings. Now, I could leave at 10am
or so when I start to get really hungry... but then I'm leaving for food
just when other people are arriving.</p>
<p>I also discovered that the Engineering canteen is much better than the
Arts or Business canteens. Spaghetti, with meat, for S$1.80, and a coke
from the drink fountain is S$0.50. In the Thai place, for example, a
coke was S$1.20. My "comfort" meals are mostly spaghetti. I sometimes
have a chicken burger at the local (to my apartment) food court -- this
was the one that I avoided on the second day, but upon later
investigation I found there *was* a "Western" place. Again, it was
filled with fried chicken stuff, but the chicken burger looked safe.</p>
<p>I have yet to make eye contact with any Caucasians in Singapore. I
haven't gone out of my way to stare at people, but whenever there's
another Caucasian, I'm aware of them and get ready to meet their eyes
and smile. But they all studiously ignore me -- even when I sit next to
them on the bus.</p>
<p>The reason I mention this is because a famous blogger (a black guy
teaching English in Japan) recounted a story where he met another black
guy in Japan and gave him the Black Guy Nod (tm). The Japanese person he
was walking with was amazed and asked how he knew the other guy. The
exchange-teacher explained that he'd never met the other guy before in
his life, but that all black men had a special Black Guy Nod (tm). He
mused on whether other minorities had similar greetings.</p>
<p>Well, it appears that there's no White Guy Smile (tm). At least, not in
Singapore. On one hand I'm disappointed, since I love having secret
handshakes and whatnot, but on the other hand it reinforces the
multicultural native of Singapore. I have to say, although Canada prides
itself on being multicultural and stuff, Singapore beats the pants off
Canada.</p>
<p>Simple example: all the food courts here have color-coded trays. Muslim
places give green trays, Chinese places give red trays, and Western
places have black/brown trays. When you return the tray to the tray
return area, there's a separate rack for Muslim and Western only.
Cultures that use pork and whatnot (forbidden by Muslim Halal) can't put
their trays on those racks. Oh yeah; most Western places here are
certified as Halal -- they don't offer any pork or use lard or whatever.</p>
<p>This really impressed me. I mean, sure, in Canada there's strict laws
against discrimination on religious grounds... but there's no such thing
as separate utensils for faiths that want to avoid certain foods. To put
it in philosophical jargon, in Canada one has a negative right to
multiculturalism, while in Singapore they have a positive right.</p>
<p>Still no rain here. Some locals are now talking about how surprising it
is that it hasn't rained in so long.</p>
<p>I finally washed my clothes, but I was surprised at how long it takes
clothes to dry in the air. I shouldn't have been surprised, of course,
but I just never thought about it. There don't appear to be any
electronic dryers in the country.</p>
<p>Another random tidbit: my hair seems to be changing to a lighter colour.
Is that normal for sunny places? Or is this an effect of the small
bottle of shampoo I got upon checking in? Or am I probably imagining
things?</p>
<p>I'm really playing a leadership role in the group, and keep on having to
give impromtu lectures about Karplus-Strong physical string modeling or
Gamelan ensembles. I'd be lying if I claimed that it wasn't going to my
head, but in some ways I wish they didn't realize how great I am -- for
the past few days I've spent about half my time mentoring PhD students.</p>
<p>Now, my first thought is that I can catch up on my own work on Saturday,
but this coming Sat there's a research group meeting and I'm giving my
thesis defense again (expanded to fill an hour). And Friday has lots of
meetings about the various research projects.</p>
<p>Oh well. I'll see if it settles down next week; if not, I'll ask the
professor about what he wants me to do.</p>

<p>I'm going to answer a bunch of emailed questions in this blog post,
under the time-honoured teacher theory that if one person asks a
question, 10 more were thinking it.</p>
<p>Singapore has an extensive public transit system. The main backbone is
the MRT (Mass Rapid Transit), which is a mostly-above-ground subway.
There's a single prepaid card you use for both the MRT and busses, which
makes travel very convenient. You tap the card when you enter and exit,
and you're charged based on the number of stops you travelled. I haven't
seen any car rental places, but there's lots of taxis around. Getting to
NUS involve 10 minutes on the MRT and 15 minutes on a bus.</p>
<p>Singapore food portions tend to be smaller than Canadian ones, so I'm
generally hungry even with 3 meals a day. That's not necessarily a bad
thing -- it makes the food I do eat seem much more tasty. For example,
the best pasta I've ever had in my life was S$2.00 (or about CDN$1.80
and US$1.60 -- I got the exchange rate the wrong way around in the last
post).</p>
<p>I'm using my eee strictly for personal business. Some days I don't even
bring it to NUS, although luckily I brought it today (I'm in a seminar
which just had two Chinese speakers). I only turn on the windows
computer when I need to proofread somebody else's papers. So most of my
life is spent on the Mac Mini running OSX 10.5.</p>
<p>The research group has 15 people. I think there's approximately 3
undergrads (NUS has undergrads doing significant research -- the speaker
just now said it was a full year of undergraduate research, which seems
incredibly high). Maybe something like 3 Masters students, 6 PhD
students, 3 PostDoc / Research Assistants... plus the professor. Ok,
subtract 1 from one of the above numbers. Other than me, everybody is
Chinese or Singaporean with Chinese ancestry.</p>
<p>The violin in the lab was bought a few years ago, and had sensors put on
it. They hired a few musicians to play it, while they videotaped it and
did bow-tracking or something like that.</p>
<p>The mobile device orchestra will of course be videotaped. I'll try to
get it posted online, but at the very minimum I'm sure I can bring a
copy back to Vancouver.</p>
<p>The proofreading was proofing other people's papers. I can communicate
fairly easily with people in the group, but even the best English
speakers here do things like writing "for buffering mechanism". (either
missing an "a" or an "s")</p>
<p>The apartment has a rice cooker, kettle, and a hot plate. I've found a
local supermarket and a "mini-mart". I haven't bought anything yet, and
I'm not certain if I'll bother. I mean, eating out is so cheap, and has
no hassle of cooking or cleaning up. This was in the local mall, which
had other stores at well.</p>
<p>Weather is a mixture of sun and cloud, and probably constant between 25
and 30. The past few days have felt a lot better than the first few
days, but I'm not certain whether that's due to me wearing shorts and
white t-shirts, getting used to the climate, or any actual change in
temperature. I saw two brief (less than 1 minute) rain showers, but no
real rain yet.</p>

<p>I forgot the power cord for my laptop at NUS on the second day, was too
hyped up to write anything on the third day, and was too tired and
stuffed to write anything on the fourth day.</p>
<div class="section" id="second-day-thursday">
<h2>Second day - Thursday</h2>
<p>On the second day, I had breakfast at a cafe called "The Grinning
Gecko", overlooking a jungle mini-valley at NUS. You'll be amazed at the
pictures when they come probably next Sat. I had their breakfast set C,
which consisted of eggs, toast, chicken bacon, lettuce, and a tomoto. I
also had some mango lemonaid, which tasted ridiculously good.</p>
<p>I then filled out more forms, collected a PC from tech support and a mac
mini from my supervisor's other lab, and met most of the other people in
the research group.</p>
<p>I've never been in a research group before. Sure, at UVic there were a
bunch of people who occasionally worked on projects together and some of
whom sat in the same room, but it wasn't like this. Dr. Wang's group
gets together to play sports and have spring music evenings and stuff.
They even eat lunch together!</p>
<p>Speaking of which, the first lunch was a disaster. They all got Chinese
food, so I followed suit, but that particular stall was out of
vegetarian dishes, so somebody suggested something with chicken in it.
For those who don't know me, I'm very picky about meat. Fatty or bloody
parts trigger my gag reflex. This chicken dish was not composed of pure
breast meat. I managed to choke down about half of it.</p>
<p>Oh, and you know those little spoon-like things that you use with
chopsticks to pick up hard-to-get pieces of spoons? I thought they were
spoons, so I took one and left the chopsticks alone. Score another point
for ignorant Westeners! (if anybody knows what those spoon-things are
called, I'm curious)</p>
<p>In the afternoon I got a walking tour of NUS from my supervisor and
discussed research plans in general. He also commented that I was very
overdressed (black jeans and an olive button-up shirt), and that nobody
at NUS cared how you were dressed and he could even give lectures in
what he was wearing. That relieved me, since I'd noticed that working
Singaporeans all wore buttoned shirts, but I figured it was better to
make an initial impression as being too smartly dressed rather than
insufficiently dressed.</p>
<p>For dinner, I went back to the same food court but had pasta (spaghetti)
from the "Western" stall. Their notation of "Western" seems to resolve
around fried chicken, and included a few dishes that definitely weren't
Western... but pasta definitely qualifies. It was very cheap (S$1.80,
which is about CDN$2.00 or US$2.25), but I discovered that it didn't
have any meatballs in the sauce.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="third-day-friday">
<h2>Third day - Friday</h2>
<p>opened a bank account. I then had the same breakfast as as the second
day, followed by more forms.</p>
<p>The morning ended with a presentation to 33 high school students from a
"top high school" -- evidently Singapore does the sensible thing and
streams students, instead of the silly Canadian system where everybody
goes to the same schools. Anyway, he gave a short presentation about
music computer research. As part of that, I inserted a mini-lesson about
the relationship between frequency and string length, mass, and tension.
He had the formula on the slide, but I figured that a one-minute speech
with violin demonstrations wouldn't hurt. The kids even predicted what
would happen when I put my finger halfway along the string... although
in retrospect, grade 12 students aren't stupid. If I couldn't have done
that by grade 8 -- even without having played cello -- I'd have been
mortified.</p>
<p>I also criticized the slides just before the presentation. One slide in
particular had a lot of black text and was unnecessarily confusing. I
suggested removing some text (in particular, "music -- appreciation --
ears -- brain". You can't appreciate music until it's reached your ears,
let alone your brain!), as well as adding some colours. After the
presentations, I also sent more criticisms to him.</p>
<p>I was a bit cautious about my initial comments, because some people
don't like criticism, but he loved it. That was a great relief for me,
since I hate working with people who don't like criticisms. Eventually I
stop making suggestions to avoid upsetting them, and then I just sit and
stew with the knowledge that I could have made things better. But that
isn't the case here; I definitely made a positive impression with my
suggestions.</p>
<p>I also wrote a long email with suggestions and links for the mobile
device orchestra. They were using the accelerometers in the ipod touch
to trigger drum sounds. Some of you may remember my performance of the
Swan and Rachminoff's Vocalise while I was an undergraduate student at
UVic. It seems like I'll be returning to that kind of work, which is
nice -- this was the first area of music technology that I pursued.</p>
<p>For lunch, I tried the Indian stall and got something that looked like a
big, thick crepe. It might have been mashed potatoes covered in batter,
although that sounds a bit weird. It came with some sauce which was
somewhat spicy.</p>
<p>For dinner, I didn't eat before I left campus, since I'd spent all my
cash on my initial bank balance deposit (actually, I had to withdraw
some cash from my Canadian debit card... I shudder to think of the bank
charges I incurred in doing so), and the first bank machine I visited
was out of cash. So I started walking along the main street in front of
my apartment, and eventually (10-15 minutes?) arrived at a shopping
plaza. It had a McDonalds, which I started to walk towards, but then I
noticed a pizza hut sign.</p>
<p>I got a regular (9") pepporoni pizza. It was S$16 (including drink),
which is ridiculously expensive by Singapore food prices, but I figured
that I deserved a treat. I think this might become my standard Friday
night thing... it's too expensive to have on a regular basis, but I was
dangerously low on one of the main food groups (grease), and it felt
very good to stuff myself.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fourth-day-saturday">
<h2>Fourth day - Saturday</h2>
<p>My normal breakfast place at NUS was closed, so I went straight to the
lab and started working. After about half an hour, some more people
arrived. Just as I was going to leave to have breakfast (about 10:30am),
my supervisor arrived. He was horrified that I hadn't eaten yet, so he
took me to eat. We went to a Chinese stall, and I got him to order
something vegetarian for me. Apparently at this stall, you get rice plus
X side dishes, so he simply pointed at three different vegetables. There
were some asparagus-like things that were quite good. I think they were
a type of bean?</p>
<p>More discussion about research projects followed, and in the afternoon I
finished proofreading my second paper and started looking at iPhone/iPod
touch development. Around 2pm I went and got lunch at the Subway on
campus, and by 3pm I headed home to sleep.</p>
<p>I dozed for a few hours, but then woke up at 7pm and went to find more
food locally. I found a food court almost immediately, but it was really
intimating -- very noisy, everybody speaking non-English (and non-French
and non-Japanese) languages, and not a scrap of English on the signs for
each stall. I ignored that area and kept on walking.</p>
<p>After 5-10 minutes of walking, I discovered another food court, but this
time I went in. The best bet seemed like a Muslim or Indian place, where
I got some small pancake-looking things. Judging from a quick glance at
wikipedia, it was naan. Anyway, that came with a soup (or maybe just
runny curry?). I tried dipping the pancake-like thing in the soup, which
seemed quite nice. I have no clue if that's what I was supposed to do,
but it seemed to work.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fifth-day-sunday">
<h2>Fifth day - Sunday</h2>
<p>I'd decided early on -- actually, I meant to add this to my resolutions
for Singapore -- that I wouldn't go in to university on the "day of
rest". That was reserved to catching up on lilypond, writing blogs, and
housework. (Mao, it's already 16:15!)</p>
<p>My MRT station is almost at the end of the line, and I'd heard that
there was a big shopping centre at the end, so I went there. I also
needed to buy a SIM card for the phone my supervisor lent to me, and I
figured this could count for my "tourist thing of the week".</p>
<p>I ended up having breakfast at Burger King. As per usual with Western
food places, a meal comes to around S$7. That might not sound too bad
(and it certainly isn't), but complete meals at non-Western places are
generally S$3 or S$4. And you know that I'm a ridiculous skinflint.</p>
<p>I returned to my apartment, then set out for lunch. I went slightly
farther than last night, since I'd heard that there was a mall there. I
found the mall, then went to a food court. I got some sugar cane juice.
This is produced by putting a length of sugar cane through a juicer.
Like, right there and then. Fresh squeezed sugar cane juice!</p>
<p>It turned out to be quite bad. Somehow it had the consistency of milk,
with a sugary taste. Almost like strawberry-flavored milk, but...
somehow wrong. I'm sure it could be an aquired taste, though. Anyway, to
choke that down, I found a vegetarian food place and asked for rice and
2 veg, then pointed at two of the vegetables I'd had for breakfast on
Sat (including the bean-like things). To make life more interesting, I
tried using chopsticks.</p>
<p>I really should have learned how to use chopsticks before coming to
Asia. I'll have to ask somebody to teach me at lunch tomorrow.</p>
