<p>More than five years since the last update!  Yikes.</p>
<p>What have I been up to?  Well, I finished my PhD in May 2013, did
two post-doctoral contracts (in Singapore and Japan), then gave up
on academia and returned to Vancouver in May 2015 to work for my
brother's company, <a class="reference external" href="https://tarsnap.com">Tarsnap Backup Inc</a>.
Since then, my main focus has been my health.</p>
<p>I've made significant changes to my diet, started practicing yoga,
lifting weights, and get at least 7 hours of cardio per week.  I
fell in love with ballroom and swing dancing, and these days I
spend more time dancing than I do on music!</p>
<p>Speaking of music, my violin-playing has improved dramatically --
I've played in all four (main) string sections of the
<a class="reference external" href="http://westcoastsymphony.ca/">West Coast Symphony Orchestra</a>
(the best non-professional orchestra in Vancouver), and plan to
play in each section at least once per season.  I'm teaching
violin and cello, and coaching a string quartet.  I've started
composing music again (after a gap of a decade), primarily for my
students.</p>
<p>It's not all good news, though.  I'm still struggling with
perfection-fueled procrastination, a la
"<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_is_the_enemy_of_good">Perfect is the enemy of good</a>").
This website is a perfect example of it: 5 years ago, I decided
that I should switch to a static website generator and stop
writing in raw HTML.  That prompted an incredible number of
hesitations:  Which generator should I use?  Which markup
language?  How can I tweak the markup and/or generator to produce
the HTML I want?  Can I add a CSS file to fix stuff, or must I
edit the template's default CSS, or must I edit the template
itself?  Which web hosting provider should I use?  Does it have
HTTPS?  etc.</p>
<p>I finally said "enough is enough", so I'm going ahead with the
revised website right now, despite all the remaining problems.  Or
rather... I said that three days ago.  Even when I started
removing whole sections of the website (e.g., music, teaching,
software), it still took me <em>days</em> to get this out the door!  My
plan is to make incremental updates to the website, trying to work
with "blocks of time" rather than "perfect chunks of update".
I'll pick some weekly time (say, "Wednesday morning before
teaching"), work on the website, and then upload the latest
version regardless of whether I'm fully satisfied with it or not.</p>

<div class="line">After over a year of development, I have released Artifastring 2.0.
This includes higher-quality output, an incredible amount of
optimizations (up to 100x realtime), and now has multiple distinct
instrument sounds: 5 different violins, 2 viola, and 3 cellos.</div>
<div class="line"><a class="reference external" href="http://percival-music.ca/artifastring/">http://percival-music.ca/artifastring/</a></div>
</div>
<p>Most of the speed improvements are thanks to the
<a class="reference external" href="http://eigen.tuxfamily.org">Eigen</a> C++ template library for linear
algebra. In particular, this enabled me to easily write SIMD code rather
than using floats.</p>
<p>Other bits of interest are the realtime OSC server and an interface for
the <a class="reference external" href="http://charlie-roberts.com/Control/">Control (OSC)</a> app. Users
with iOS or Android tablets can control the physical modelling with
their fingers! I'm hoping to have a video in a few days, although I
still need to find somebody with a video camera. Before you get too
excited, I should add that this is a proof-of-concept of the
communication between tablet and computer; I haven't put any thought
towards the actual GUI or ease of control. My focus is on finishing my
thesis, so if anybody is interested in making better interfaces, go
nuts!</p>

<p>There's sure to be rough edges left in this release. I'm trying to force
myself to accept "the perfect is the enemy of the good". I'm having huge
problems writing my thesis because whenever I write down what I've done,
I think of possible flaws, which immediately prompts me to spend a week
or two performing experiments which justify what I've done (or else
demonstrate a real problem, in which case I spend another week or two
changing even more!).</p>
<p>With that in mind, I expect a 2.2 release to happen within the next
month or two. Of course, if more people test the 2.0 version and report
problems, I'll have more confidence (and more motivation!) to get the
2.2 release out there.</p>

<div class="line">Ubuntu 10.04 LTS has a serious bug in ssh/ssh-agent/something which
causes it to fail to log in to a system even if you have your ssh
identies set up. This caused me an hour of panic before I found a
workaround. I'm putting it here in case somebody else has the same
problem and google finds this for them. (tl;dr: use
<tt class="docutils literal">SSH_AUTH_SOCK=0sshfoo.bar.baz</tt> )</div>
</div>
<p>I swap between two laptops and a desktop regularly. I have a shared
dotfiles git repository, so my normal settings are fine -- but that
won't work for stuff like email passwords, or even email. My current
setup is to use an sd card for personal stuff. (yes, my stuff is in an
encrypted loop-back partition on that card; I'm not crazy!)</p>
<p>A few days ago (just after returning to Glasgow), I started having read
errors on the card. This was particularly sucky because although I'd
bought a new 16gb card while in Vancouver, I hadn't gotten around to
carrying that new card, so I was using my old 8gb card. I was planning
on doing it "soon", but I definitely started to kick myself for not
getting it set up sooner.</p>
<p>That said, it was only about 24 hours since I'd made a backup of the sd
card anyway, and there hadn't been any truly important emails in that
time. (I know the story should go "... but I didn't mind, because I'm
using my brother's tarsnap backup service", but it was actually about 3
days since I'd backed up in tarsnap)</p>
<p>Fortunately, when I put the card in a different laptop, it read it just
fine. I copied stuff over, checked that things seemed ok, and then
started using the new card regularly. Everything seemed fine for a day
or two, when I discovered that I couldn't log in to various servers. At
this point, I turned to tarsnap to get a backup of my <tt class="docutils literal">ssh</tt> directory,
thinking that I'd gotten some freaky bitrot in my private key but
nowhere else. No joy.</p>
<p>But wait, it gets worse! Take a look at this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
gperciva@gperciva-desktop:~$ ssh -v strauss.elec.gla.ac.uk

</pre>
<p>LOLwut? Server accepts key, agent admitted failure to sign in using the
key?!</p>
<p>After a bit of stumbling around, I found a <a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-keyring/+bug/201786">ssh bug
report</a>
from 2008 in the ubuntu database. Apparently you can work around it by
setting <tt class="docutils literal">SSH_AUTH_SOCK=0</tt>. You can also do some weird stuff with
something called "seahorse", but I think I'll just export the variable.</p>
