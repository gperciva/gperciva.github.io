<p>The big deadline is over. There's a few smaller projects to work on, but
these can be done at a much more relaxed pace. So now it's time to start
doing my promised tourist stuff!</p>
<p>Last Sunday, I did the thing that tops every list of tourist activities
for this country: I went shopping. Well, window shopping. I didn't
expect to buy anything, and I didn't. Other than food; I got a block of
Australian mild cheddar. This was the first real cheese I've had in
months... sure, melted Kraft plastic cheese slices don't taste
horrible... but I like cheese that, when I bite it, it knows that it was
bitten.</p>
<p>No, I don't know what that means either. It just sounded cool to me.</p>
<p>Anyways, I spent a girly two hours window-shopping. Mostly looking at
laptops; I was thinking about getting a better laptop. But I couldn't
find any Asus eee laptops around! Plenty of other small laptops, but not
the brand that started the whole craze. I <em>did</em> discover that prices
here were't as bad as I thought. Actually, once I factor in the taxes
(which in Canada aren't part of the sticker price, whereas here they
are), I guess laptop prices are just about the same.</p>
<p>It might be for the best that I couldn't find a laptop, though. I can
probably get a better machine in a few months, and I didn't particularly
want to go through customs and airport security with two laptops.</p>
<p>I also discovered that the Jurong Bird Park is in Jurong! Yeah, it
sounds obvious in retrospect, but it was news to me. That means it's
close to my apartment, so I'll go there next.</p>

<p>Some minor points about daily life here:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I occasionally see girls sporting the "wearing only a t-shirt" look.
Upon second glance -- and believe me, a second glance is involved --
I realize that they <em>are</em> wearing shorts... just really, really
high-cut ones. Combined with a long t-shirt, there's only 2-3cm of
shorts visible.
... I'm not complaining.
It seems weird to be talking about "high-cut" rather than "low-cut",
but there you go.</li>
<li>Speaking of girls, a few days ago I had a shower in the morning. I
didn't want to braid my hair while it was still sopping wet (it'd
never dry), so I left it in a ponytail. When I was on the bus to
university, I decided that I really was too informally dressed, so I
braided my hair on the bus. I felt quite proud of myself for this
accomplishment... and I'm sure that everybody who was at the party
last Dec 26 and watched the hair-braiding lesson and saw my initial
attempts at self-braiding would also be proud.
Yes, I take "letting one's hair down" literally here; it's only done
at home. To tell the truth, it's mostly a heat thing -- when my
<a class="reference external" href="http://improbable.com/projects/hair/">Luxuriant Flowing Hair</a> is
loose, it raises my neck's temperature by at least three degrees,
which (when squared) turns into nine degrees of suffering.
... yes, suffering is the square of physical conditions. I don't know
quite what that means either, but it sure sounds cool, doesn't it?
(cool... I could really go for some cool right now)
That said, only Indian women here braid their hair; the other Asians
here keep it loose or in a ponytail. I can't fathom how they can bear
it, although their hair isn't as thick as mine.</li>
<li>Food-wise, I'm still suffering. I'm even getting tired of Subway
food... though their cookies are still fantastic. But a steady stream
of almost-daily Subway meals has robbed them of their novely / reward
factor.</li>
<li>A few weeks ago, I said that weather reports were pointless because
it was always the same. Well, not quite; the temperature is getting
hotter. Yes, scientifically (or linguistically) speaking that's
nonsense; temperature does not get hotter or colder. But in a
subjective sense, the temperature definitely <em>is</em> getting hotter.
Much hotter. Two showers a day is not at all extreme.</li>
<li>University is in their exam period now, which means that most of
those pesky undergraduates aren't around, so the cafeterias are much
nicer.</li>

<p>Wow, it's been a while! I've been sick, had a huge deadline, and got
slightly better. No, this isn't an exact repeat of the last update...
although it somewhat feels like it.</p>
<p>My sickness this time was just a common cold/flu thing, caused from lack
of food. Eating enough food here is a serious concern. I've taken to
going to Subway or Burger King almost every day, just to make sure I
have at least one normal meal. When I spent last Tuesday in bed, I even
switched to coke rather than diet coke, just to increase my calory
intake. Yeah, I know that fast food and soda being the "healthy
alternatives" says really sad things about my ability to forage in this
country.</p>
<p>On the plus side, I'm almost finished the big project. After that, I'll
only work 5 days a week. That should give me more energy to explore the
island (including the more Western-oriented food stores, Western hangout
areas, etc).</p>
<p>Apparently one of my grandmothers checks the Singapore weather every
day. That's nice, but completely unnecessary -- every day is the same.
It's 29 plus or minus 2 degrees. There's an 80% chance of the day being
entirely sunny. If it rains, there's a 50% chance of it being a downpour
that lasts for about an hour. 25% chance of only a mild shower, and 25%
chance of it being a downpour that lasts for 2-3 hours. Any downpour is
accompanied by thunderstorms.</p>
<p>Perfect example of how unnecessary the weather prediction is: the
evening news doesn't even bother to report it. In Canada, every newscast
contains a weather report. I wish there <em>was</em> some variation in weather
to report, though. :(</p>
<p>Actually, wait; there <em>is</em> one extra point. When it really downpours
here, I can't see the buildings on the other side of the lake outside my
apartment. Even the trees about 10 meters away from my window are
noticeably obscured. It's like having a thick fog, but I'm pretty sure
it's just from the descending water rather than floating water.</p>
<p>Other "news"... to celebrate the almost-finished project, I bought some
Toblerone chocolate. Normally I'm too cheap to buy blatant chocolate
like that, but it was on sale, and I wanted to celebrate. So I splurged
S$7.</p>
<p>That's not so much "news" as just an illustration of my life here --
nothing's been happening. I'm not complaining, by the way. I <em>want</em> my
daily life to be boring; it's my research that should be interesting.
I'd talk about that, but I'm not certain how much interest there is in
hearing about it... and in any case, I should probably wait until the
reviews are done.</p>
<p>I had a few other random observations to make, but I can't remember them
now. Oh well; when this project is finished in a few days, I should be
posting more often.</p>
<hr class="docutils">
<p>Only 47 days until I return to Vancouver! And before everybody tells me
what I should see in Japan on the way, let me remind you that my
connecting flight is 2 hours and 20 minutes after I arrive in Narita. So
unless you want to tell me about a particularly interesting shop in the
International departure lounge at Narita (any maid cafes there? 'cause
that would be awesome!), don't bother. :)</p>
<p>I'm somewhat regretting this choice -- two of my closest friends are in
Japan right now, and it'd be neat to visit them. But I'm not going to
cancel my air tickets... and besides, I miss my mountains and cat.</p>

<p>Wow, it's been a while! I've been sick, had a huge deadline, and got
slightly better. Still not great health, but at least it doesn't hurt at
the moment. Anyway, a friend from Vancouver visited me... err... two and
a half weeks ago?</p>
<p>It was weird how un-weird it was. I mean, when you meet somebody on the
other side of the world -- the only non-electronic connection to your
normal life back home that you're likely to get during your entire stay
here -- you'd expect it to be weird, right? Or at emotional or
something?</p>
<p>But no, there was none of that. I arrived at the meeting place --
arranged via email, since he didn't have a phone here -- a few minutes
late, looked around at the dozen people sitting at the tables, then
decided he hadn't arrived yet. As I started to walk away (to be closer
to the entrance), he stood up and followed me. Whoops; I'd completely
missed him. (in my defense, I must say that his pink shirt did not suit
him!)</p>
<p>"Hey." "Hey." ... pause... "Wanna go get some pizza?" "Sure, I'm
starving".</p>
<p>I talked about the lack of familiar food; he talked about Malaysian
hotels screwing up his laundry. I talked about my work environment; he
talked about almost dying in Bangkok. It was just like normal! OK,
medical emergencies weren't normal... but despite the topic, the tone of
the conversation was normal.</p>
<p>He was amazed at the lack of smell in Singapore. Also at how clean it
was, and how we had sidewalks. The latter two points didn't surprise me,
but I hadn't realized that a lack of stench was a big plus for urban
centers. I guess it's a good thing that I'm not sight-seeing in the
nearby countries. :)</p>
<p>Mao, I miss Victoria (aka "Bunny Land"). IMO, Singapore (and Vancouver)
do smell. Not in a "garbage stench" kind of way; just in a "lots of cars
and stuff" way. I think I've turned into a "small town" guy rather than
a "big city" guy.</p>
<p>Anyway, I showed him my place. His first reaction was "this amount of
space is criminal", which stuck in my mind and turned into the title of
this post. He's now in Japan... I wonder how criminal he thinks this
place is now. ;)</p>
<p>Let's see... not much else has been happening, other than work. Oh, a
woman asked me for directions. I didn't realize that I looked anything
close to being a local. Then again, maybe that prompted her to approach
me. I mean, the only reason an obvious foreigner would have to be in a
residential district would be if he lived there, so I'd obviously know
where the local supermarket was. Anyway, I directed her and assume she
found the right place.</p>
<p>I might actually restart my attempts at doing touristy things on
Sunday... due to my health issues, I've been home this weekend (instead
of working on Sat), and it feels much better. If I make this a regular
occurence, then I can use Sat for rest and catching up on email, and Sun
for touristy stuff. We'll see how things go in the next few weeks.</p>
