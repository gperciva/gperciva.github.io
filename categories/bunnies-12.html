<p>I'm back in Vancouver!</p>
<p>Due to the creative time-keeping imposed by tradition (time zones are
stupid; we should just do everything with GMT), this blog post is
approximately 24 hours after the last one, despite the actual local time
reported on each blog post being only being 12 hours apart.</p>
<p>Singapore Changi airport definitely <em>is</em> a nice airport, but I must
admit that the novel was starting to wear thin after 12 hours. I was
really glad to finally board the ANA flight to Narita.</p>
<p>That flight had the individual seat-mounted movie/video/music/game
screens. No power on the seats, though, which made it considerably less
comfortable than the flight from Vancouver to Hong Kong. I managed to
spend about S$35 on souveniers and S$100 on food+drinks (including
buying dinner and drinks for the two group members who came all the way
out the airport to visit me, and in one case carry my luggage. Thanks
again, guys!)</p>
<p>Narita airport was... ok. Not as bad as Heathrow, but nowhere as nice as
Changi. After waffling for a bit, I decided to switch my remaining
Singapore cash into yen. I didn't know if I'd actually find something to
use it on, but I was in a rare spending mode, and I figured that S$64
wouldn't get me far in other countries anyway. After changing all that
cash at the first place I saw, I had 3884 yen. What can you do with
that? In particular, what can you do with that inside the controlled
area of the Narita airport?</p>
<p>First, I went to a bookstore, and picked up volume 26 of Mahou Sensei
Negima. Yeah, that's no way I'll be able to read it (there's lots of
kanji), but... it's Negima! I had to buy it! ... ok, at least one of you
will understand that, and that's more than enough approval for me.</p>
<p>I also picked up a simple manga that had the hiragana and katana written
beside the kanji. And, for that matter, there weren't many kanji to
begin with. On later inspection, I think it's really aimed at young
girls... but I was getting it for reading practice, not to evaluate it
for a literary award.</p>
<p>No, I don't know what the actual title is, since it's written in very
stylized characters. It's by peach-pitt, which is a team that's turned
out some quite nice work in the past.</p>
<p>Then I stopped at the last store before my gate and looked for things to
waste money on. Eventually my eye came to rest on the display of cell
phone strap decorations. I don't even have a cell phone, and everybody
that I know which has cell phones don't attach decorations to them...
but these seem to be really popular in Japan, and most of them were just
so gaudy that I figured that I had to get a few.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I didn't really think about how many I was getting... and
I didn't really think about what "380 - 400 yen" meant (i.e.
approximately $4). So I ended up buying something like $20-worth of
silly, gaudy, impractical cell phone straps.</p>
<p>Oh well. It's not like 2150 yen would do me much good in Canada, either.
After that, I only had coins left, so I bought a bad muffin and some
mango juice. I ended up bringing 134 yen home.</p>

<p>The flight home turned out to be in a refurbished A330-300, so I had
power for my laptop! And individual video screens, although the movies
being offered this time weren't very good. Apart from "Bolt", which was
a great animated movie about a dog actor that thinks that his super-dog
powers are real.</p>
<p>The flight wasn't perfect; there was a crying baby right next to me...
but it was still a good trip. In addition, I was at the very front of
the economy-class cabins. So I got food and drink first, I could leave
first (other than the business-class people), and I had a bit more
legroom than normal economy-class seats.</p>
<p>Canadian immigrations wasn't bad -- it was much, much better than when I
returned from Belfast in late Aug. That was the same time as all the
international students were arriving in Vancouver, and it was on a
weekend, so it took about 90 minutes to get through immigration. This
time it was only foo minutes.</p>
<p>My cat was very happy to see me, and I'm uploading this blog post while
laying on the floor of my living room -- if I went anywhere else, my cat
would complain.</p>

<p>I've decided that I like airports. Everything is clean and tidy, the
staff are so helpful and polite, etc. Granted, you pay over seven
dollars for a chocolate mint frappe, but you can't have everything!</p>
<p>Out of all the airports I've visited... yes, all of Vancouver, London
Heathrow, Belfast, Vancouver, Hong Kong, and Singapore Changi... the
Singapore Changi airport is the best. I've heard other people say it,
and I really believe it.</p>
<p>I managed to get my boarding pass and dump my large suitcase ten hours
before my flight. So I'm now in the post-immigration checkpoint area
with my small suitcase, enjoying the free wifi and power. And somewhat
struggling to stay awake... I'm scared that if I fall asleep, the
kittens will eat me. Err, I mean, I might sleep through my flight time.</p>
<p>But hey, I wouldn't be a computer geek if I couldn't stay up all night,
so I'm sure that I can make it onto the plane. And at that point, the
more tired I am, the better -- I normally can't sleep on planes, so
hopefully I can sleep this time.</p>
<p>While I was wandering around, I noticed a post office. So I sat down to
write postcards to Canada and the US... but when I was finished, the
post office was closed! Yes, it closed at midnight, and I missed it by
two or three minutes. :( I forget when it opens in the morning; I may or
may not send postcards before I leave Singapore.</p>

<p>Things are winding down now. I went to the Science Centre, which was
disappointing -- I'd seen many of the exhibits at Science World (in
Vancouver) 15 or 20 years ago. And it was a lot more kid-centered than
Science World... or at least, it was much more kid-centered than I
remember Science World being. From when I visited it. When I was a kid.</p>
<p>I discovered that there was a "snow centre" right next door. Judging
from the website, it's an indoors area with snow! The temperature in
Singapore has only dipped below 20 degrees once in recorded
temperature-history (since 1934, IIRC) -- and it was still 19.4 C
degrees then! So it must be a real novelty to natives here.</p>
<p>On one hand, I wish that I'd discovered this months ago -- I could have
spent every Friday evening there, or something! On the other hand, it's
probably good that I didn't discover it, because I would have spent a
lot of money there. :)</p>
<p>Yesterday, the research group went to MacRitchie Reservoir, went along
the Tree-Top Walk (it's like the Capiliano suspension bridge in North
Vancouver, except long and narrower -- it's one-way only). I think we
ended up walking about 10km. Inside the canopy of the rainforest, it
wasn't as hot as outside. Sometimes I think it was even below 28
degrees!</p>
<p>Near the beginning of the journey, we saw a few monkeys in a tree. While
most of us were saying things like "aww, so cute!" and taking pictures,
one of the few Singaporean citizens in the group commented that monkeys
were viscious little buggers and were not cute at all. He went on to
explain that he'd been chased by a bunch of monkeys, and it wasn't fun
at all.</p>
<p>I proceeded to mock him for running away from cute little things like
that (he'd served in the army, making the mockey especially irresistable
for me), and claimed that I could intimidate a dozen of those cat-sized
critters. I then paused, and remarked that this was the perfect setup
for ten monkeys to swarm down from the trees and beat me to death.</p>
<p>That didn't happen, of course. Comedy: 0, hubris: 1.</p>
<p>Later on, we were walking down a hill on the trail, and the dirt track
had a few loose stones (size of a fist) scattered along it. He commented
how annoying it was to avoid the rocks or balance on them, and I
proceeded to boast about how easy it was, when you had proper footwear
and experience doing so. "I love jumping from rock to rock when hiking
in the mountains in Canada, and--"</p>
<p>-- in mid-sentence, I put my right foot down on a rock that rolled to my
left, causing my weight to descend on right ankle at an angle that the
human body was not designed to support. Yep, perfect setup, perfect
timing. Comedy: 1, hubris: 1.</p>
<p>After a few moments of pain, and longer moments of dizziness, I limped
on. There wasn't much else to do, and it didn't seem too serious. As
long as I walked funny, it didn't hurt. Any injury that you can walk
away from is a good injury, right? For some value of "good", at least.</p>
<p>Three hours later, after a great meal at pizza hut with the group, I got
home, had a shower, then looked up "ankle sprain" on wikipedia (the most
reliable source of medical diagnoses and treatment in the world). I put
some ice cubes inside a hand hand towel folded in half, then settled
down to watch Singaporean TV while alternating between having ice on my
ankle, and putting my ankle on the top of the couch (the only way to
elevate it above my heart, which is apparently one of the recommended
treatments, according to the ultra-reliable source).</p>
<p>The first few times that I got up after being stationary for a while, it
was worse than ever. But later in the evening, it felt better, and I
could hobble around the apartment without a steady stream of
obscenities. It's a good thing that all my roommates have moved back to
their countries! May 13, May 20, May 28... we've been counting down the
days anxiously. :)</p>
<p>Anyway, right now (approximately 24 hours after the injury), I can walk
almost normally, and I can rotate my ankle with only a few twinges of
pain. I'm going to be fine... so this just makes for a great story of
comedy and hubris.</p>
<p>(I will, however, note that I did not literally fall down. I'm still
agile enough to pull my weight off the foot, reposition it, then catch
myself before hitting the ground.)</p>
