<p>T minus three and a half days.</p>
<p>Getting ready for this trip has almost been a job unto itself. There was
the proposal. Then forms for the university and forms for the
government. Approval, then more forms. Finding a place to stay. More
forms and sending an international money order to put a deposit on the
place.</p>
<p>Oh goody, time to get my suitcases ready... oh wait, each airline has
their own baggage regulations. And even though all flights were booked
through Air Canada (and all tickets are under an AC number), I need to
look through each airline's websites to find the info. Air Canada lets
you take 2 bags of up to 23 kg <em>each</em>. Most Asian airlines let you take
any number of bags, with a <em>total weight</em> of 20 kg. I've narrowed the
luggage requirements down to: 1 bag of checked luggage (up to 20 kg),
and 1 bag of carry-on luggage (up to 10kg).</p>
<p>I have the checked luggage bag packed. OK, it's a bit early, but I
wanted to see what clothes I had, and once I had them all together, I
figured that I should <em>keep</em> them together. It's a good thing I
investigated, since I only have 6 pairs of white socks that don't have
holes (or almost-holes) in them. I'm going shopping tomorrow.</p>
<p>In the interests of soliciting advice from anybody who's traveled more
than me (i.e. more than once in the past eight years), here's my
tentative list of what I'm taking:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Clothes, hairbrush, hair ties, shaver, toothpaste, etc.</li>
<li>Laptop (eee pc), power converter.</li>
<li>Camera (an old digital camera with a 64-meg mini-SD card. For
reference, I bought a 4-gig micro-SD card for my laptop last week for
$9.99)</li>
<li>Travel documents, copy of Master's degree, passport-sized photos for
government documents, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course I'm not bringing my interesting t-shirts, like my De-CSS or
the FreeBSD Daemon one. People often ask me about books, but I'm not
planning on bringing any. Academic papers are on my laptop in pdf form,
and any fiction books would only last for half the plane trip over. I'm
not taking any musical instruments, since I don't have any musical
things lined up and that would make luggage exponentially more
difficult.</p>
<p>I keep on thinking that I'm forgetting something, but whenever I look
around my room for anything I'm missing, I come up blank. I think it's
just that I have no idea what I'm getting myself into -- I think the
farthest East I've gone has been Italy (for about five days), and now
I'm flying off to live in Asia for five months.</p>

<p>All the cool kids are doing reviews of the past year, so I figured that
I should do some kind of a review too. Of course, lots of un-cool people
are also doing reviews, but we all know that I'm one of the cool ones.</p>
<p>At the beginning of Nov, I started accompanying a musical on the cello.
I wouldn't normally play a musical -- there's too many performances, so
I'm generally bored with the music by opening night, let alone by the
end! -- but it had been two years since I'd done any semi-serious music,
so I thought it would be a good exercise. I'm happy to report that I've
still "got it going on". Yes, the first two weeks hurt a bit -- playing
the cello takes a lot more muscle than violin -- but I was still able to
keep track of everybody in the ensemble, and could often pinpoint
mistakes before the music director could.</p>
<p>I wanted to get all my old compositions in a publishable state, but that
didn't happen. This wasn't entirely my fault -- I was waiting for
<a class="reference external" href="http://lilypond.org">lilypond 2.12</a> to be released -- but I could
have done more prep work so that it would have been faster to finalize
them. Oh well; at least that will give me something relaxing to work on
in Singapore.</p>
<p>In other news, I've been accepted to the University of Glasgow for the
PhD. I still need to work out the funding; the tuition is over 12,000
pounds per year. But apparently in the UK one has to get accepted by the
university before one applies for scholarships, so this means I'm one
step closer.</p>
<p>I'm not really certain what to do about MEWER now. I'm hesitant to start
advertizing it, because if there's any problems I can't fix them while
I'm in Singapore. On the other hand, it's probably good enough to help
some people, so it'd be a shame not to mention it to them.</p>
<p>Finally, I'm becoming the next release manager of lilypond, and starting
up a <a class="reference external" href="http://percival-music.ca/gop/">Grand Organization Project</a> for
lilypond. The Grand Documentation Project was a great success, so I'm
hoping to do the same thing on a larger scale.</p>

<p>My father is fond of telling people that he used to work at SIN
(Schweizerisches Institut fur Nuklearphysik). Well, I'm surpassing him
-- I don't need to work at it. I'm just going to SIN. Jan 5 to May 28.</p>
<p>Hmm. It's approximately 30 km from the airport to the university. If I
keep on running through the winter, I could probably run that distance
by the time I go there.</p>
