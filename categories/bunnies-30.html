<p>I'm happy to announce the release of GNU LilyPond 2.14. LilyPond is a
music engraving program, devoted to producing the highest-quality sheet
music possible. It brings the aesthetics of traditionally engraved music
to computer printouts. Many improvements have been made in the past two
and a half years since the previous main stable version. (yes, that's a
long time between stable versions!)</p>
<div class="section" id="lilypond-is-doing-great-lilypond-is-headed-for-disaster">
<h2>LilyPond is doing great! LilyPond is headed for disaster!</h2>
<p>On one hand, we're doing great. The new stable version 2.14.0 is finally
out, we've finally started the <a class="reference external" href="http://lilypond.org/~graham/gop/">Grand Organization
Project</a> to resolve various
administrative problems, and there are no huge problems which will stop
us from releasing 2.16.0 in a few months.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we still have far too many tasks concentrated in far
too few people. This is not healthy, both for the individuals doing the
work, but also for the project as a whole.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sustainable-development-in-software-projects">
<h2>"Sustainable development" in software projects</h2>
<p>Every person will leave the LilyPond project sooner or later. Our lives
change, our hobbies shift, and unfortunately our health and lifespans
are not infinite. What would happen if, for example, I decided that my
PhD thesis and future career were more important than LilyPond and that
I should drop out the project?</p>
<p>(this is not an idle question; I honestly <em>should</em> quit LilyPond. Some
open-source volunteering would still be good for my career, but it would
be much more benefitial for me to spend that time on
<a class="reference external" href="http://marsyas.info/">Marsyas</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/">ChucK</a>, or even
<a class="reference external" href="https://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/stk/">STK</a> instead. Those
project are much more aligned with my research and potential
tenure-track jobs, and I would learn much more by working on them
instead of LilyPond.)</p>
<p>Such problems are charmingly referred to a project's <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor">Bus
factor</a>: how many people
would need to be hit by a bus before the project falls into disarray?
LilyPond has a quite low bus factor -- losing as few as three people
would cause massive problems.</p>
<p>I gave a
<a class="reference external" href="http://percival-music.ca/blog/2010-08-01-sustainable-development.html">presentation</a>
at RMLL 2010 about this last year, and I was reminded of this by a
recent <a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.gnome.org/bolsh/2011/05/31/effective-mentoring-programs/">discussion about mentoring
efforts</a>
by a gnome developer looking at the approximate 25% success rate (over a
variety of projects, including LilyPond).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="decentralization">
<h2>Decentralization</h2>
<p>A low "bus factor" means that work (or knowledge or power) is highly
concentrated in a few people. It's much better for the project if
work/knowledge/power is distributed more evenly -- losing one person
will cause fewer problems.</p>
<p>There are other benefits to decentralization, of course. A lower
workload on "central" people will lessen burn-out, which may encourage
them to stick around for longer. That can, in turn, lessen the workload
on other people: there are many cases where an "old-timer" can make a
few suggestions in a 5-minute email which save a new contributor
literally hours of work and frustration. Everybody wins!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dangers-of-burn-out">
<h2>Dangers of burn-out</h2>
<p>I'm (in)famous on the LilyPond mailing lists for arguing against new
proposals. "We don't have the resources / nice idea, but wait until... /
you can do that with a user .ly file / etc".</p>
<p>In some cases this is due to my subscribing in a certain philosophy of
design: <em>Il semble que la perfection soit atteinte non quand il n'y a
plus rien à ajouter, mais quand il n'y a plus rien à retrancher.</em>
(perfection is finally attained not when there is no longer anything to
add, but when there is no longer anything to take away; from <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Antoine_de_Saint_Exup%C3%A9ry">quotes
from Antoine de Sainte
Exupéry</a>).
A similar idea was mentioned by Steve Jobs in a <a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.forbes.com/carminegallo/2011/05/16/steve-jobs-get-rid-of-the-crappy-stuff/">recent
interview</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus
on. But that's not what it means at all. It means saying no to the
hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully.
I'm actually as proud of the things we haven’t done as the things I
have done. Innovation is saying 'no' to 1,000 things.</blockquote>
<p>But the other part is that I simply don't want more work. Every single
time that somebody comes up to me with an excited new idea, it breaks my
heart because my first thought is "oh boy, now I need to express polite
enthusiasm". It doesn't matter if it's over email, in a chat, in a
meeting, or in a private conversation. Doesn't matter if it's from a
longtime developer or an unknown user. Doesn't matter if I think it's a
brilliant idea, an obvious but useful improvement, or a pie-in-the-sky
ludicrous concept. My first thought is always the same: "bleh, more
work".</p>
<p>At the moment, I'm committed to doing 10 hours of LilyPond work per
week. I've "saved up" a few hours from the previous two months
(including my vacation) because I knew that I'd be busier after 2.14
came out -- at the time of this writing, I have 12 hours of LilyPond
time left. Each Monday morning, I add 10 hours to that figure. By my
estimation, only considering the published <a class="reference external" href="http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.13/Documentation/contributor/grand-organization-project-_0028gop_0029">Grand Organization
Project</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.13/Documentation/contributor/grand-lilypond-input-syntax-standardization-_0028gliss_0029">Grand LilyPond Input Syntax
Standardization</a>
backlogs, I won't be able to do make any LilyPond bugfixes or new
features of my own until the end of 2011. My entire time will be spent
organizing and helping other people to do work.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="you-can-help">
<h2>You can help</h2>
<p>Get involved! Anything that makes LilyPond less centralized will help.</p>
<p>Even if it has nothing to do with me personally, there will probably be
a "trickle up" effect from reducing the burden of other people. For
example, if a translator started doing some of the work of Francisco
(the Translation Meister), he would have more time to investigate
problems himself instead of asking me to help. Similarly, if a developer
offers to seriously mentor one or two new programmers, that might mean
one or two fewer programmers who come to me for help because everybody
else is ignoring them. If you're a new contributor, then spend some
extra time talking to other new contributors -- provide moral support
and somebody to commiserate with, even if you can't discuss anything
technical!</p>
<p>As for me personally... I spend about 2 hours a week on completely
mindless administration. Stuff that could almost be done by a computer
program. I could easily write 5 or 6 sentences on paper, and somebody
could follow those blindly. For example, twice a week I send a "patches
countdown" email.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>go to the <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/lilypond/issues/list?can=2&amp;q=label:patch%20patch=review&amp;sort=patch&amp;colspec=ID%20Type%20Status%20Priority%20Stars%20Owner%20Patch%20Summary">list of patches for
review</a>
</li>
<li>pick two or three issues</li>
<li>find the codereview URL inside the issue</li>
<li>click on that link</li>
<li>if there are any reviews, check that the last review is not negative</li>
<li>include the subject line and link to the codereview page in an email
to lilypond-devel</li>
</ol>
<p>All I need to offload this task is a reliable person who doesn't mind a
bit of boredom offering to do it. 15 minutes, twice a week. If there's
anything unusual, I'm happy to discuss it (and possibly modify the
instructions to handle such cases). But I'm not asking for any knowledge
or creativity.</p>
<p>There are other tasks which <em>would</em> require knowledge and/or creativity.
For example, many people ask for a changelog -- what's new in each
release? If somebody is interested in lilypond development, they could
spend 1-2 hours a week reading the developer email list and the git
changelog, then writing a 3-4 sentence summary for each release. That
would be a nice "gentle" introduction to how things work, and it would
benefit many users.</p>
<p>Similarly, there are some tasks which are regular weekly affairs, and
others which are one-time. Here's a great non-really-technical one-time
task: our list of <a class="reference external" href="http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.15/Documentation/contributor/major-release-checklist">places to send release announcements
to</a>
is quite old. Half of the links don't work. So I haven't bothered to
make any release announcements (other than our own webpage) at all. If
somebody wanted to spread the word, they could spend 2-5 hours looking
for relevant places to announce lilypond, maybe asking for other
suggestions from lilypond-user, and make a nice list. Then either send
our release announcement to those places himself, or else ask me to do
it. I wouldn't mind doing it as long as all the links work and I don't
need to hunt around to find out how to send the announcement (i.e. give
me a specific link to the announcement form, not a generic link to the
main website!)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="square-pegs-into-round-holes">
<h2>Square pegs into round holes</h2>
<p>In the past, we haven't done a good job of organizing people in
LilyPond. Some people are suited to regular work; other people are
suited to one-time jobs. Some people like technical challenges and
creative freedom; other people prefer a rigid set of guidelines so they
know that they're not making any mistakes.</p>
<p>We need people for all sorts of tasks, and over the next few weeks, I'm
really going to try to make sure that everybody has a job that suits
them. We've lost a lot of potential effort by asking people to do tasks
which don't really appeal to them, and then not having those jobs "open"
when another person offers to help.</p>

<p>In other news, I'm still working on the refactoring of the source code.
I barely got any work done during my 3-week vacation, which I guess
could be considered to be a good thing?</p>
<p>I'll be making some posts about general-interest parts of the vacation
over the next few days or weeks, but at the moment my focus has to be
work. I spent 3 days in bed (almost) recovering from exhaustion, so I've
got even more work to catch up on.</p>

<div class="line">Artifastring 1.4 is now out (now including video output!), along with
a heartwarming story: another person is working on this project!
Welcome to Marcos Press ("tdy")!</div>
<div class="line"><a class="reference external" href="http://percival-music.ca/artifastring/">http://percival-music.ca/artifastring/</a></div>
</div>
<p>I introduced Vivi to the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">lilypond-user</span></tt> mailing list, sparking a long
discussion, on both the technical accomplishments of Vivi and the
musical implications of such work. But in the middle of it, I received a
very kind offer of a violin model in <a class="reference external" href="http://blender.org">blender</a>.
Blender is a Free 3D content creation suite; amonst other things, it can
create animations. I was using that for Vivi already, but only with very
primitive output -- 4 cylinders for the strings, 1 cylinder for the bow,
cones for the fingers, etc.</p>
<p>He sent along an image of the violin, and it looked quite nice. So I
wrote back to say that I was very interested, and did he also have a bow
model?</p>
<p>He replied that he didn't have a bow model yet, but that he'd do it
right away, because the bow was easier to do than a violin. A few hours
later, he sent me a file with both models.</p>
<p>The small picture I saw earlier did not do it justice. His models were
literally jaw-dropping. It includes a sound post. It includes the wires
attaching the tailpiece to the knob at the bottom of the violin. It
includes curved f-holes. The strings have different colors of windings.
The tailpiece has actual holes -- or rather, not just circular holes,
but correctly-shaped holes -- into which the strings fit. The bridge has
notches in which the strings fit. Ditto for the nut. The strings wind
around the tuning pegs.</p>
<p>The below picture doesn't do it justice, either... I should have rotated
the violin a bit more so that you could see more details of the bridge.
But spending the whole blog post talking about a video without showing
any graphics would be a bit weird.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://percival-music.ca/blogfiles/vivi-video.jpg"><img alt="Frame from video" src="http://percival-music.ca/blogfiles/vivi-video.jpg" style="width: 50.0%;"></a> (click to enlarge)</p>
<p>After I got the file, I must have spent about 30 minutes just looking at
the model. Zooming in, zooming out, rotating... everywhere I looked,
there was an incredible amount of detail. I need to learn how to make a
"fly-by animation" in blender, to show off all the pieces of this.</p>
<p>The model also included some text inside the violin, like a "maker's
mark". I didn't notice it for the first 20 minutes or so, but when I
read it, I almost cried.</p>

<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>Now, I've been working on open-source projects for a long time... since
2003, actually. I've released my own software as open source. At times,
I've spent over 60 hours a week on existing open-source projects. I've
trained approximately 30 people to do documentation work (admittely,
about half of them just read the guidelines I wrote and didn't need any
further guidance). I've directly caused literally hundreds of hours of
work, mostly on LilyPond. I've reviewed patches, mentored new
contributors, and seen those contributors to become much more
knowledgeable than me and tell me off for things (that's my favorite
part of mentoring :). I've had people express interest in work that I'd
abandoned, and I passed the source code along to them.</p>
<p>But this is the first time that somebody's sent a contribution to one of
my own projects, and it's a whole new feeling.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br></div>
</div>
<p>I also feel even more inspired to make Vivi better -- with Marcos' work,
the sound quality is much worse than the video quality. I need to
improve her bow control much more. I was already planning on doing that,
of course, but now I have even more motivation. :)</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Here's an example of the videos it produces:</div>

<p>So again, Marcos -- thank you so much! To other people: I've got a
github repository now, and more bits and pieces will be coming in the
next few days. What are you waiting for? :)</p>
