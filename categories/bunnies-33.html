<p>When I first heard about the Roomba robotic vacuum cleaner, it
sounded like something for the truly lazy -- how hard is it to
spend ten minutes vacuuming your floor once a week?</p>
<p>Then I tried it.</p>
<p>When I first moved into my condo, I borrowed my brother's Roomba
for a week.  By chance, my parents went on holiday for two weeks
after that, so I borrowed their Roomba.  By that point, I was
hooked.</p>
<p>You see, it's not a matter of "vacuuming your floor once a
<em>week</em>".  When I had a robotic cleaner with an easily-cleanable
dustbin, I ran it once a <em>day</em>.  And that wasn't me being paranoid
-- I emptied that dustbin every day so I could see how much dust
it was removing from my environment.</p>
<p>After 2.5 years of use, my Roomba started showing a blue starfish
error light, and it made a "clunking" sound as if it couldn't get
into gear.  Time for some serious cleaning!</p>
<div class="section" id="cleaning">
<h2>Cleaning</h2>
<p>(There's a few youtube videos about this floating around, but I
was annoyed at having to watch a 5-minute video to get this info
when a few images and text would have done it just fine.)</p>
<p>First, remove the yellow brushes (with 1 small screw) and the 4
main screws:</p>
<p><img alt="image1" src="../images/roomba-cleaning/roomba-cleaning-1.jpg" style="width: 565.0px;"></p>
<p>Next, remove the 4 small screws holding the blue-and-grey "brush
box" and lift it out:</p>
<p><img alt="image2" src="../images/roomba-cleaning/roomba-cleaning-2.jpg" style="width: 565.0px;"></p>
<p>Now bend the blue arms backwards so that you can pop the grey
plastic out.  There's a wire connecting the back of the blue and
grey part (see the next two images), which you can leave
connected:</p>
<p><img alt="image3" src="../images/roomba-cleaning/roomba-cleaning-3.jpg" style="width: 475.0px;"></p>
<p>This is sufficiently detached.  Look at the right-hand side of the
grey box (in the below image).  You want to undo 5 screws.</p>
<p><img alt="image4" src="../images/roomba-cleaning/roomba-cleaning-4.jpg" style="width: 816.0px;"></p>
<p>Here's the gear-box!  Looks fairly icky thanks to my long hair:</p>
<p><img alt="image5" src="../images/roomba-cleaning/roomba-cleaning-5.jpg" style="width: 500.0px;"></p>
<p>Close-up of one of the gears.  Some of those gear-teeth are
completely jammed with dust (a bit hard to tell since the dust
reflected the light):</p>
<p><img alt="image6" src="../images/roomba-cleaning/roomba-cleaning-6.jpg" style="width: 500.0px;"></p>
<p>In addition to removing the hair, I also used a small screwdriver
to clean out the gear-teeth.  I happily put the Roomba back
together again -- but the problem persisted.</p>
<p>After a few more disassembly-and-cleaning attempts, it occurred to
me that in addition to removing the hair and dust, I'd also
removed any grease and oil.  I added some bicycle grease, put it
back together, and the Roomba worked perfectly!</p>
<p>(I suspect that bicycle grease isn't ideal type of lubricant for
this purpose, but that's what I had easily available to me.)</p>

<p>More than five years since the last update!  Yikes.</p>
<p>What have I been up to?  Well, I finished my PhD in May 2013, did
two post-doctoral contracts (in Singapore and Japan), then gave up
on academia and returned to Vancouver in May 2015 to work for my
brother's company, <a class="reference external" href="https://tarsnap.com">Tarsnap Backup Inc</a>.
Since then, my main focus has been my health.</p>
<p>I've made significant changes to my diet, started practicing yoga,
lifting weights, and get at least 7 hours of cardio per week.  I
fell in love with ballroom and swing dancing, and these days I
spend more time dancing than I do on music!</p>
<p>Speaking of music, my violin-playing has improved dramatically --
I've played in all four (main) string sections of the
<a class="reference external" href="http://westcoastsymphony.ca/">West Coast Symphony Orchestra</a>
(the best non-professional orchestra in Vancouver), and plan to
play in each section at least once per season.  I'm teaching
violin and cello, and coaching a string quartet.  I've started
composing music again (after a gap of a decade), primarily for my
students.</p>
<p>It's not all good news, though.  I'm still struggling with
perfection-fueled procrastination, a la
"<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_is_the_enemy_of_good">Perfect is the enemy of good</a>").
This website is a perfect example of it: 5 years ago, I decided
that I should switch to a static website generator and stop
writing in raw HTML.  That prompted an incredible number of
hesitations:  Which generator should I use?  Which markup
language?  How can I tweak the markup and/or generator to produce
the HTML I want?  Can I add a CSS file to fix stuff, or must I
edit the template's default CSS, or must I edit the template
itself?  Which web hosting provider should I use?  Does it have
HTTPS?  etc.</p>
<p>I finally said "enough is enough", so I'm going ahead with the
revised website right now, despite all the remaining problems.  Or
rather... I said that three days ago.  Even when I started
removing whole sections of the website (e.g., music, teaching,
software), it still took me <em>days</em> to get this out the door!  My
plan is to make incremental updates to the website, trying to work
with "blocks of time" rather than "perfect chunks of update".
I'll pick some weekly time (say, "Wednesday morning before
teaching"), work on the website, and then upload the latest
version regardless of whether I'm fully satisfied with it or not.</p>
