<p>Room description without pictures. Pictures are not a priority and will
happen later.</p>
<p>First impression: sweet mao this is huge!</p>
<p>At the door, I paused to take my shoes off, but the manager told me not
to bother. That surprised me -- I thought all Asian cultures were very
down on shoes inside -- but she's the boss.</p>
<p>My personal room is bigger than my old bedroom at home. It's over twice
as big as my room in Victoria. This really surprises me -- I've heard so
much about the density of cities in Asia, and I read somewhere that
Singapore was either the densest (sp) or second-densest country in the
world. But I guess that once you start going vertical in a big way, you
get a lot of "extra" space. My room is on the 8th floor of 15, by the
way.</p>
<p>In some ways the room (not just my bedroom, but also the dining area and
living area) are too big. They look quite sparse. Sounds seem to echo a
lot and I felt like I was being really noisy when I was moving around at
2am, but apparently it didn't wake up anybody.</p>
<p>Went to sleep at about 3am, woke up at 7am. That's 3pm in the afternoon
by Vancouver time, which seems reasonable as a continuation of my
26-hour sleep cycle.</p>
<p>I think the room is facing east. There was certainly a lot of sun.
Remember that Singapore is basically on the equator, so sunrise/sunset
is pretty stable at 7am/7pm. There's a lot of traffic on the street
outside -- maybe a bit more than Canada Way (at home). Maybe the idea of
being up at 9am every day will be easy!</p>
<p>Looking out the window, I was struck by the first time I wanted to use
the term "riot of colours". The railing on my private balcony is light
blue -- I hadn't noticed that at night. There's massive amounts of green
on the sides of the road and surrounding the lake. I've commented in the
past that my (old) area in Victoria makes Vancouver look pathetic; this
place gives Victoria a run for its money. There's areas of bright red
bricks on the road. Admittedly the lake isn't a nice brilliant blue. I
think I'd rather swim in Burnaby Lake than this one.</p>
<p>Now for the comparison with my parents:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Bringing sheets: Dad was half-right. The mattress has a sheet (ground
sheet? bed sheet? What are they called?), but no upper sheet. I got a
blanket (as expected), but I'm not certain if I'd use it.
When I arrived at the room, I was going to take off another mark from
Dad on this one since I wouldn't need a sheet, but it felt too weird
to try to go to sleep without any cover.
I didn't think about what "30 degrees C" meant. Remember those days
in the summer where you feel overdressed while naked? It's like that
here all the time.</li>
<li>Pillow: Mom was wrong, I got a pillow.</li>
<li>Slippers: Dad was right, those were extremely useful on the flight,
and I think I'll wear them around the apartment.</li>
<li>Kimono (or whatever the male equivalent is, if that's the female
one): my parents were right; my lack of one is distressing. Oh yeah,
if anybody has suggestions for what type of Asian light wear I should
get, please let me know. As you can tell, I don't know the basics of
what the clothing is called or what gender they're for.</li>
<li>Sweaters: Mom was wrong; I don't need any sweaters. The
air-conditioned areas are still 21 - 23 C, which is emminently
T-shirt conditions.</li>
</ul>

<p>In summary, the room is much nicer than I expected.</p>

<p>Ok, I'm here now.</p>
<p>The first flight was very nice. It was a Boeing 777-300, and it had LCD
displays on the back of every seat, and power sockets on most seats
(including mine -- I chose my seat for that reason). This means that I
can use my laptop for the 13-hour 45-minute flight. :)</p>
<p>I've decided to do this blog post piecemeal; I'm writing stuff as it
occurs to me. That's easier than trying to remember everything at the
end. I'll probably be switching between present and past tense, though.
It's currently one hour into the flight.</p>
<p>At 4 hours, I'm listening to current French pop songs. It seems that as
long as I can't understand the lyrics, I enjoy popular music a lot more.
(yes, I can speak French, but picking out lyrics in the middle of a song
is beyond me, especially when I'm deliberately not trying to listen.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately all is not sweets and roses on this flight. The LCD is
nice, but a number of features -- include the "Map" menu -- are not
functioning. The error message is polite, but I wanted to see where we
were on the map, how far we'd travelled to date, etc.</p>
<p>7 hours now. I don't feel too bad, which is good 'cause it's only half
over. The thin slippers that Dad brought back from Japan (they was an
omake for some first-class train tickets) help a lot. They're coming
around with hot beverages, which will be followed by dinner. There's
still one more meal coming; 2 hours before the end, they give out hot
noodles. I've never been on a flight with three meals and six or seven
drinks before... but then again, I've never been on a 13.75 hour flight.
I was surprised by the amount of localization. Hot drinks include green
tea, and the standard chicken hot lunch meal came with chopsticks. I'm
not surprised because this doesn't make sense; I'm just surprised that
the business is flexible enough to have different meals on different
international flights.</p>
<p>I underestimated the amount of suckage involved in working on an
airplane -- and the amount that I normally fidget. It's not unusual for
me to have a foot on my desk, for example. Not in the classic "fat cat"
pose, though. My laptop is on the desk like normal, and I kind-of slouch
sideways. With one leg contorted around. Anyway, as of 12 hours, I've
gotten about 5 hours of work done. Spent 5 hours watching movies/TV
shows and/or eating, and about 2 hours of snoozing.</p>
<p>Hong Kong airport wasn't fun, since the first flight was delayed and
they had poor signage. Seriously, who names the international tranfer
flight check-in area "W1"? Also, either Air Canada shouldn't have
printed my second boarding pass, or the security guard should have
accepted it and not made me jog off to get a new one printed. I entered
the security line-up at the time I was supposed to be at the gate for
boarding. But after a bit more jogging, I arrived on the second plane.</p>
<p>The second flight was uninteresting in terms of airplane model (IIRC it
was a 777), food, entertainment, lack of sights (pitch black and me not
near a window anyway). I dozed for a bit.</p>
<p>Singapore airport was a model of efficiency; within 20 minutes of
stepping out of the airplane, I was stepping out of the airport. The
customs girl was very nice and smiled at me as I stuttered through my
explanation of my job (she had previously asked when I was starting my
studies, since I look so much like a student). She waved away my attempt
to show her my exiting flight (you're required to show proof of the next
destination if they ask).</p>
<p>The baggage carousel was actually the most nerve-wracking part. In the
future, I think I might get some yellow paint and draw a huge happy face
on the suitcase or something... there were just too many black
suitcases.</p>
<p>Of course, the airport experience might be quite different if I hadn't
arrived at midnight with nothing else arriving. Then again, my
supervisor (the one here, not my old supevisor) says that he's travelled
in over 40 countries, and the Singapore airport is the best.</p>
<p>Taxi ride was ok. A woman on the flight in said that it would be "really
really expensive... like S$30" and tried to think of other ways I could
get to my apartment, but in the end agreed that since the MRT was closed
and there probably wasn't a direct bus, it wasn't worth it. The taxi
ended up being S$40.20, but the driver gave me S$10 back when I handed
him a S$50 and waved off my apologies for not having any coins. I
figured that S$40 wasn't bad for a 35-minute drive mostly exceeding
100km/h. I definitely couldn't get a deal like that in Vancouver!</p>
<p>Impressions of the city at night: looked like any metropolist in North
America. There's a huge port, lots of construction, big skyscrapers.</p>
<p>First impression upon stepping out of the taxi: sweet mao it's hot. And
it's past midnight!</p>
<p>There wasn't anybody around when I arrived at my apartment, but the
security was very nice and friendly, and called up the manager. She came
down after five minutes, and was very friendly and got me checked in. I
got the info for wireless, but my computer wasn't set up to deal with
their particular encryption scheme (WEP), so I'm still just typing this
and will send tomorrow from the university.</p>
<p>Arrival at room, 1:30am. I spent an hour writing blog posts, emails, and
attempting to get the wireless working.</p>

<p>Overall impression: Singaporeans are extremely nice and helpful. The
manager didn't show any signs of minding being woken up at 1am (she
thought I was arriving tomorrow), the security guy didn't give me any
glares for not knowing what I was doing, the only reactions to my braid
(that I detected) was occasional mild curiosity, and the customs agent
didn't transform into a tentacle monster and rip apart my paperwork and
suitcases.</p>

<p>T minus 36 hours or so.</p>
<p>Suitcases are packed, other than this laptop + power cord + hair brush.
Printed out invitations letters, copied map to apartment, etc. Finally
finished moving all files over to my new laptop.</p>
<p>One friend had a really great idea: wear a shirt for customs. I'm taking
this a step further and wearing my best clothes (well, best apart from
full orchestra dress). Shirt, dress pants, braid, make-up... ok, not the
last one. I won't be as comfortable when traveling, but anything that
makes government officials easier to deal with is worth it.</p>
<p>I'm also making a few resolutions. New Year's resolutions are a big
thing in North America, but I've never bothered with them. And I'm still
not -- these are strictly aimed at Singapore, not life in general.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Work from 9 to 5, unless it's obvious that the research group behaves
otherwise. Yes, it's totally unnatural to wake up at the same time
every day, but I'm going to try to do it for the five months.</li>
<li>Do one touristy thing every week (probably on Sunday). I've glanced
at a few tourist guides, and the only thing that remotely caught my
eye was the crocodilarium (a zoo, just for crocodiles, with over a
thousand beasts). But I'll force myself to stop working and go visit
something. And with my superior cheapness, I'll do my best to enjoy
whatever I pay money to see.</li>
<li>Impose a strict "1 week and you're out" email policy. I have the
evening for catching up on emails, so this <em>shouldn't</em> be difficult,
but I'll find some time (maybe Sunday evening?) to do my final
replies and then delete whatever's left.</li>
<li>Never refuse to try any vegetarian non-alcoholic dish. I don't have
my PhD so I still won't touch alcohol, and I'm extremely cautious
about stuff that came from animals (seafood included). Fortunately,
Singapore seems to really push multiculturalism and there's a good
fraction of Buddhists, so I can probably ask for vegetarian food
without offending anybody.</li>
