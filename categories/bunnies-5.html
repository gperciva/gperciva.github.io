<p>I'm going to answer a bunch of emailed questions in this blog post,
under the time-honoured teacher theory that if one person asks a
question, 10 more were thinking it.</p>
<p>Singapore has an extensive public transit system. The main backbone is
the MRT (Mass Rapid Transit), which is a mostly-above-ground subway.
There's a single prepaid card you use for both the MRT and busses, which
makes travel very convenient. You tap the card when you enter and exit,
and you're charged based on the number of stops you travelled. I haven't
seen any car rental places, but there's lots of taxis around. Getting to
NUS involve 10 minutes on the MRT and 15 minutes on a bus.</p>
<p>Singapore food portions tend to be smaller than Canadian ones, so I'm
generally hungry even with 3 meals a day. That's not necessarily a bad
thing -- it makes the food I do eat seem much more tasty. For example,
the best pasta I've ever had in my life was S$2.00 (or about CDN$1.80
and US$1.60 -- I got the exchange rate the wrong way around in the last
post).</p>
<p>I'm using my eee strictly for personal business. Some days I don't even
bring it to NUS, although luckily I brought it today (I'm in a seminar
which just had two Chinese speakers). I only turn on the windows
computer when I need to proofread somebody else's papers. So most of my
life is spent on the Mac Mini running OSX 10.5.</p>
<p>The research group has 15 people. I think there's approximately 3
undergrads (NUS has undergrads doing significant research -- the speaker
just now said it was a full year of undergraduate research, which seems
incredibly high). Maybe something like 3 Masters students, 6 PhD
students, 3 PostDoc / Research Assistants... plus the professor. Ok,
subtract 1 from one of the above numbers. Other than me, everybody is
Chinese or Singaporean with Chinese ancestry.</p>
<p>The violin in the lab was bought a few years ago, and had sensors put on
it. They hired a few musicians to play it, while they videotaped it and
did bow-tracking or something like that.</p>
<p>The mobile device orchestra will of course be videotaped. I'll try to
get it posted online, but at the very minimum I'm sure I can bring a
copy back to Vancouver.</p>
<p>The proofreading was proofing other people's papers. I can communicate
fairly easily with people in the group, but even the best English
speakers here do things like writing "for buffering mechanism". (either
missing an "a" or an "s")</p>
<p>The apartment has a rice cooker, kettle, and a hot plate. I've found a
local supermarket and a "mini-mart". I haven't bought anything yet, and
I'm not certain if I'll bother. I mean, eating out is so cheap, and has
no hassle of cooking or cleaning up. This was in the local mall, which
had other stores at well.</p>
<p>Weather is a mixture of sun and cloud, and probably constant between 25
and 30. The past few days have felt a lot better than the first few
days, but I'm not certain whether that's due to me wearing shorts and
white t-shirts, getting used to the climate, or any actual change in
temperature. I saw two brief (less than 1 minute) rain showers, but no
real rain yet.</p>

<p>I forgot the power cord for my laptop at NUS on the second day, was too
hyped up to write anything on the third day, and was too tired and
stuffed to write anything on the fourth day.</p>
<div class="section" id="second-day-thursday">
<h2>Second day - Thursday</h2>
<p>On the second day, I had breakfast at a cafe called "The Grinning
Gecko", overlooking a jungle mini-valley at NUS. You'll be amazed at the
pictures when they come probably next Sat. I had their breakfast set C,
which consisted of eggs, toast, chicken bacon, lettuce, and a tomoto. I
also had some mango lemonaid, which tasted ridiculously good.</p>
<p>I then filled out more forms, collected a PC from tech support and a mac
mini from my supervisor's other lab, and met most of the other people in
the research group.</p>
<p>I've never been in a research group before. Sure, at UVic there were a
bunch of people who occasionally worked on projects together and some of
whom sat in the same room, but it wasn't like this. Dr. Wang's group
gets together to play sports and have spring music evenings and stuff.
They even eat lunch together!</p>
<p>Speaking of which, the first lunch was a disaster. They all got Chinese
food, so I followed suit, but that particular stall was out of
vegetarian dishes, so somebody suggested something with chicken in it.
For those who don't know me, I'm very picky about meat. Fatty or bloody
parts trigger my gag reflex. This chicken dish was not composed of pure
breast meat. I managed to choke down about half of it.</p>
<p>Oh, and you know those little spoon-like things that you use with
chopsticks to pick up hard-to-get pieces of spoons? I thought they were
spoons, so I took one and left the chopsticks alone. Score another point
for ignorant Westeners! (if anybody knows what those spoon-things are
called, I'm curious)</p>
<p>In the afternoon I got a walking tour of NUS from my supervisor and
discussed research plans in general. He also commented that I was very
overdressed (black jeans and an olive button-up shirt), and that nobody
at NUS cared how you were dressed and he could even give lectures in
what he was wearing. That relieved me, since I'd noticed that working
Singaporeans all wore buttoned shirts, but I figured it was better to
make an initial impression as being too smartly dressed rather than
insufficiently dressed.</p>
<p>For dinner, I went back to the same food court but had pasta (spaghetti)
from the "Western" stall. Their notation of "Western" seems to resolve
around fried chicken, and included a few dishes that definitely weren't
Western... but pasta definitely qualifies. It was very cheap (S$1.80,
which is about CDN$2.00 or US$2.25), but I discovered that it didn't
have any meatballs in the sauce.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="third-day-friday">
<h2>Third day - Friday</h2>
<p>opened a bank account. I then had the same breakfast as as the second
day, followed by more forms.</p>
<p>The morning ended with a presentation to 33 high school students from a
"top high school" -- evidently Singapore does the sensible thing and
streams students, instead of the silly Canadian system where everybody
goes to the same schools. Anyway, he gave a short presentation about
music computer research. As part of that, I inserted a mini-lesson about
the relationship between frequency and string length, mass, and tension.
He had the formula on the slide, but I figured that a one-minute speech
with violin demonstrations wouldn't hurt. The kids even predicted what
would happen when I put my finger halfway along the string... although
in retrospect, grade 12 students aren't stupid. If I couldn't have done
that by grade 8 -- even without having played cello -- I'd have been
mortified.</p>
<p>I also criticized the slides just before the presentation. One slide in
particular had a lot of black text and was unnecessarily confusing. I
suggested removing some text (in particular, "music -- appreciation --
ears -- brain". You can't appreciate music until it's reached your ears,
let alone your brain!), as well as adding some colours. After the
presentations, I also sent more criticisms to him.</p>
<p>I was a bit cautious about my initial comments, because some people
don't like criticism, but he loved it. That was a great relief for me,
since I hate working with people who don't like criticisms. Eventually I
stop making suggestions to avoid upsetting them, and then I just sit and
stew with the knowledge that I could have made things better. But that
isn't the case here; I definitely made a positive impression with my
suggestions.</p>
<p>I also wrote a long email with suggestions and links for the mobile
device orchestra. They were using the accelerometers in the ipod touch
to trigger drum sounds. Some of you may remember my performance of the
Swan and Rachminoff's Vocalise while I was an undergraduate student at
UVic. It seems like I'll be returning to that kind of work, which is
nice -- this was the first area of music technology that I pursued.</p>
<p>For lunch, I tried the Indian stall and got something that looked like a
big, thick crepe. It might have been mashed potatoes covered in batter,
although that sounds a bit weird. It came with some sauce which was
somewhat spicy.</p>
<p>For dinner, I didn't eat before I left campus, since I'd spent all my
cash on my initial bank balance deposit (actually, I had to withdraw
some cash from my Canadian debit card... I shudder to think of the bank
charges I incurred in doing so), and the first bank machine I visited
was out of cash. So I started walking along the main street in front of
my apartment, and eventually (10-15 minutes?) arrived at a shopping
plaza. It had a McDonalds, which I started to walk towards, but then I
noticed a pizza hut sign.</p>
<p>I got a regular (9") pepporoni pizza. It was S$16 (including drink),
which is ridiculously expensive by Singapore food prices, but I figured
that I deserved a treat. I think this might become my standard Friday
night thing... it's too expensive to have on a regular basis, but I was
dangerously low on one of the main food groups (grease), and it felt
very good to stuff myself.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fourth-day-saturday">
<h2>Fourth day - Saturday</h2>
<p>My normal breakfast place at NUS was closed, so I went straight to the
lab and started working. After about half an hour, some more people
arrived. Just as I was going to leave to have breakfast (about 10:30am),
my supervisor arrived. He was horrified that I hadn't eaten yet, so he
took me to eat. We went to a Chinese stall, and I got him to order
something vegetarian for me. Apparently at this stall, you get rice plus
X side dishes, so he simply pointed at three different vegetables. There
were some asparagus-like things that were quite good. I think they were
a type of bean?</p>
<p>More discussion about research projects followed, and in the afternoon I
finished proofreading my second paper and started looking at iPhone/iPod
touch development. Around 2pm I went and got lunch at the Subway on
campus, and by 3pm I headed home to sleep.</p>
<p>I dozed for a few hours, but then woke up at 7pm and went to find more
food locally. I found a food court almost immediately, but it was really
intimating -- very noisy, everybody speaking non-English (and non-French
and non-Japanese) languages, and not a scrap of English on the signs for
each stall. I ignored that area and kept on walking.</p>
<p>After 5-10 minutes of walking, I discovered another food court, but this
time I went in. The best bet seemed like a Muslim or Indian place, where
I got some small pancake-looking things. Judging from a quick glance at
wikipedia, it was naan. Anyway, that came with a soup (or maybe just
runny curry?). I tried dipping the pancake-like thing in the soup, which
seemed quite nice. I have no clue if that's what I was supposed to do,
but it seemed to work.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fifth-day-sunday">
<h2>Fifth day - Sunday</h2>
<p>I'd decided early on -- actually, I meant to add this to my resolutions
for Singapore -- that I wouldn't go in to university on the "day of
rest". That was reserved to catching up on lilypond, writing blogs, and
housework. (Mao, it's already 16:15!)</p>
<p>My MRT station is almost at the end of the line, and I'd heard that
there was a big shopping centre at the end, so I went there. I also
needed to buy a SIM card for the phone my supervisor lent to me, and I
figured this could count for my "tourist thing of the week".</p>
<p>I ended up having breakfast at Burger King. As per usual with Western
food places, a meal comes to around S$7. That might not sound too bad
(and it certainly isn't), but complete meals at non-Western places are
generally S$3 or S$4. And you know that I'm a ridiculous skinflint.</p>
<p>I returned to my apartment, then set out for lunch. I went slightly
farther than last night, since I'd heard that there was a mall there. I
found the mall, then went to a food court. I got some sugar cane juice.
This is produced by putting a length of sugar cane through a juicer.
Like, right there and then. Fresh squeezed sugar cane juice!</p>
<p>It turned out to be quite bad. Somehow it had the consistency of milk,
with a sugary taste. Almost like strawberry-flavored milk, but...
somehow wrong. I'm sure it could be an aquired taste, though. Anyway, to
choke that down, I found a vegetarian food place and asked for rice and
2 veg, then pointed at two of the vegetables I'd had for breakfast on
Sat (including the bean-like things). To make life more interesting, I
tried using chopsticks.</p>
<p>I really should have learned how to use chopsticks before coming to
Asia. I'll have to ask somebody to teach me at lunch tomorrow.</p>

<p>I'm now competent at getting around in Singapore, have a grown-up email
address (<tt class="docutils literal">percival@location</tt> -- previously only my father has one of
those!), and have my employment pass.</p>
<p>Getting the MRT (their version of skytrain, which is Vancouver's
mostly-above-ground subway) was ok. I made trips to a few electronic
ticket booths before finding out that I was to buy the EZ pass (prepaid
debit card system for transit) at the counter.</p>
<p>I then might have committed my first cultural blunder. There was an
escalator that was crowded, and stairs that were unused. I assumed that
everybody was being lazy and went up the stairs, but when I was almost
at the top I noticed an "exit" sign. There wasn't a "do not enter" sign
at the bottom (I think -- I'll have to check on my way home). And I
haven't noticed any distinction (other than running escalators) in other
stations. I felt a bit conspicuous, though.</p>
<p>Got to NUS, but couldn't reach my supervisor's office -- it was behind a
keycarded area. I hung out in front of the door for a few minutes,
trying to see if I could send him an email (I couldn't), and a girl (or
woman) came along. I asked her to knock on his door, but she just let me
into the area and I made my way to his office and met him.</p>
<p>He was suprised to see me so early; he'd told me that I should be
well-rested for my first day in Singapore and we didn't have to meet
until 11 or so, but since I woke up early I figured there was no point
not going. We then chatted a bit and then saw the HR person for advice
on which formalities should be done next. Unfortunately the answer was
"get the employment pass", so I headed off downtown to visit the
Ministry Of Manpower. And yes, they do actually abbreviate it as MOM.</p>
<p>When I arrived and got my ticket, they were processing number 265. I was
404. That's not quite as bad as it sounds, though -- in the first 10
minutes, they handled 25 numbers. Later on I estimated that they'd done
60-70 in half an hour.</p>
<p>What is as bad as it sounds is that after receiving my documents, they
took them off to be processed. Come back in 3 hours. I wondered whether
to transit back to NUS, but it was two MRT lines and a bus ride, so I
opted to wander around in downtown Singapore.</p>
<p>Ravenous for food, I started looking for some. I ended up in the food
court in the main mall in Chinatown, whereupon I... well, I'm sure you
can all guess. I left as soon as possible and wandered in the direction
that seemed most likely to get me Western food.</p>
<p>Yes, I know that I'll be unable to survive in Singapore if I don't try
other foods, and yes, I should have done more preparing. I was actually
intending to suggest Asian take-out whenever my friends got together to
watch anime, but that hasn't happened sinnce... I don't know. September?
July?</p>
<p>Anyway, there's a time to try new food, and a time to stick with what
you know. On a day like today, you stick with what you know.</p>
<p>After about 30 minutes of walking in the insane heat and sun, I saw a
7-11. I considered going there and getting whatever they had (warmed-up
hot dog, maybe? I don't know what they have in 7-11s here), but it was
on the other side of a major street and there weren't any cross-walks
around. So I kept on walking, and saw a KFC in the distance.</p>
<p>Just as I was about to enter the KFC, I noticed a sign for Subway on a
bus stop. It was pointing towards the building, and I then noticed a
mall entrance beside the KFC. Inside the "electric town" mall, I found
the subway. Which was good, because I had been seriously considering
asking somebody for directions. Now, that might not sound so terrible,
but I'd have asked for "Western food", not just "food". I don't know
quite where that ranks in the list of stupid American tricks, but it's
got to be in there somewhere.</p>
<p>On way back from that mall, I noticed other Subway store and Western
food that I'd missed -- mere meters away from the MRT station I left. I
spent a good deal of time walking through that mall ("Central mall"),
which seemed to be aimed at tourists.</p>
<p>At MOM again, I was 470 and they were processing 380. I waited for
another 60 minutes in the queue. I don't know why we couldn't pay when
we drop off our passports and whatnot. The pickup would take a minute!
Come to think of it, even though we had to pay, I still don't know why
it took some people longer than a minute. I mean, I handed over my
ticket number, my old ticket number, and S$100 in cash. The clerk gave
me back S$50 and told me it was only S$30, fetched my bundle, and gave
me another S$20. Literally over in 60 seconds!</p>
<p>It was 4:40pm at that time, and I'm still jetlagged, so I went straight
home. I've got the wireless working now (the magic words were
"wep_key0", which do not appear anywhere in the man page for
wpa_supplicant. Looking up help online for how to connect to the
internet is one of the most frustrating things. Especially in this case,
where I knew it would take at most 3 minutes... oh well. Got it working
now.</p>
<p>What I don't have working is email. After trying to send email a few
times from both NUS and my apartment, I realized that my computer was
still set up to use shaw's smtp server. No wonder it was dying! However,
I haven't found any info about smtp servers here yet.</p>
