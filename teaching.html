<h2>Python for audio programming</h2>
<p>We've started teaching the fourth-year audio programming class in
python.  Labs are here:</p>
<blockquote>
<a class="reference external" href="teaching/python">Python programming course</a>
</blockquote>
<p>Why write a whole new introduction to python?  Well, I wanted to
focus on exactly the stuff we needed for the class.  Also, these
poor kids haven't been taught how to program before, so I wanted
to introduce the building blocks of programming rather than just
giving a quick overview of python for programmers.  But I didn't
want to throw them at Zed Shaw's "Learn python the hard way",
since that would cover python in more depth than they need.</p>

<div class="section" id="c-programming">
<h2>C programming</h2>
<p>I am an outspoken opponent of teaching C to new programmers -- C
is a horrible language.  It requires compiling, it has no array
bounds checking, it uses non-obvious symbols like |, etc.  Using C
to teach the concepts of conditionals, loops, functions, and
arrays is absolutely stupid.  There are <em>far</em> better
languages for this task; my favorite is Python.</p>
<p>However, it seems to be the language of choice for departments of
electrical engineering.  I've written these labs and used them for
the past two years, and they seem to work decently-well.  They're
not perfect, but I'm uploading them here on the off chance that
anybody else finds them useful:</p>

<p>If you're trying out any of these labs and notice a problem,
please let me know so I can fix it!  The best way to generate good
course material is to test it over and over again.</p>
