<h1>Camp Tasks</h1>
<p>
Many campers help out with various tasks at camp.  This year,
we're trying to organize these jobs in advance.  Please consider
volunteering to do help out with one or more of these tasks.
</p>
<details><summary id="office-staff">Office staff</summary>
<p>We are expanding the &quot;camp librarian&quot; position, asking volunteers to run the office during open hours by helping people with:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>searching the library and signing out music</li>
<li>using the photocopier</li>
<li>distributing extra blankets, pillows, and toilet paper</li>
<li>signing out laundry cards</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>After the first full day, most of this time will be idle. Feel free to use this time to add bar numbers to your music, check email, practice yoga, etc.</p>
<p>Time:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>20 minute training session on camp Sunday</li>
<li>a daily shift (camp Monday to Friday) of up to 1 hour</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Ideally, we would like to have 6 volunteers, and have the following &quot;office hours&quot; on Monday to Friday:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>7:00 - 7:40am (overlapping early breakfast)</li>
<li>8:10 - 8:45am (overlapping late breakfast, mini-concert, and session 1)</li>
<li>10:40 - 11:00am (snack)</li>
<li>2 - 3pm</li>
<li>6:50 - 7:15pm (overlapping late dinner)</li>
<li>8 - 8:45pm</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition, we would like 1 or 2 volunteers to staff the office on:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>the final Saturday, 11am - 12:45</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</details><details><summary id="setup-and-teardown">Setup and teardown</summary>
<p>There's a lot of physical set-up to do on the first Sunday (and undone on the following Saturday):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>move tables and chairs in the classrooms</li>
<li>carry electronic keyboards to rooms and set them up</li>
<li>move instruments from AC 323 to 3rd floor library</li>
<li>move children's instruments</li>
<li>set up chairs in the MPR and 3rd floor library</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If you're willing to help with any of these, please sign up! The more people we have, the easier it will be to distribute these tasks.</p>
<p>Physical requirements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>ability to walk unaided</li>
<li>ability to lift 10 pounds (some tasks require more strength, but there's plenty of &quot;light-weight&quot; tasks as well!)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Time:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>on Sunday and Saturday: anywhere from 30 minutes to 6 hours (your choice)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</details><details><summary id="camp-porters">Camp porters</summary>
<p>Every so often we need to move things during camp:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>children's instruments from their room to the MPR for their concert</li>
<li>reorganizing the MPR before &amp; after the Monday night social activity</li>
<li>chairs to/from MPR and 3rd floor library</li>
<li>electronic piano to outside cafeteria for a mini-concert</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If you're open to being approached to help with any of these tasks, please sign up! You will <strong>always</strong> have the opportunity to decline a particular task (e.g., &quot;I have a rehearsal now&quot;, &quot;I need to take care of my kids&quot;, &quot;I'm just too tired at the moment&quot;). Signing up simply means &quot;I don't mind if I get asked to help with tasks&quot;.</p>
<p>Physical requirements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>ability to walk unaided</li>
<li>ability to lift 10 pounds (some tasks require more strength, but there's plenty of &quot;light-weight&quot; tasks as well!)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Time:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>during the week: 5-10 minutes each.</p>
<p>(These are short tasks! Other than the children's concert setup, which will require multiple trips.)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>After the final concert, there's usually 8-12 volunteers sorting out the large ensemble music. Each person takes a box of unsorted music (e.g., all the orchestra parts for the large choral work) and sorts it in the order the parts appear in the score.</p>
