<h1>Camp Tasks (SAMPLE)</h1>
<details><summary id="camp-office-staff">Camp Office Staff</summary>
<p>We are expanding the &quot;camp librarian&quot; position, asking volunteers to run the office during open hours by helping people with:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>searching the library and signing out music</li>
<li>using the photocopier</li>
<li>distributing extra blankets, pillows, and toilet paper</li>
<li>signing out laundry cards</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>After the first full day, most of this time will be idle. Feel free to use this time to add bar numbers to your music, check email, practice yoga, etc.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Time:</dt>
<dd><ul>
<li>20 minute training session on camp Sunday</li>
<li>a daily shift (camp Monday to Friday) of up to 1 hour</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Ideally, we would like to have 5 volunteers, and have the following &quot;office hours&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>8:10 - 8:45am (slightly overlapping breakfast and session 1)</li>
<li>10:40 - 11:00am (snack)</li>
<li>2 - 3pm</li>
<li>6:45 - 7:15pm (overlapping dinner)</li>
<li>8 - 8:45pm</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</details><details><summary id="camp-porters">Camp Porters</summary>
<p>There's a lot of physical set-up to do on the first Sunday (and undone on the following Saturday):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>move tables in the classrooms</li>
<li>carry electronic keyboards to rooms and set them up</li>
<li>move instruments from AC 323 to 3rd floor library</li>
<li>move children's instruments</li>
<li>move chairs</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If you're open to being approached to help with any of these tasks, please sign up! The more people we have, the easier it will be to distribute these tasks.</p>
<p>You will <strong>always</strong> have the opportunity to decline a particular task (e.g., &quot;I have a rehearsal now&quot;, &quot;I need to take care of my kids&quot;, &quot;I'm just too tired at the moment&quot;). Signing up simply means &quot;I don't mind if I get asked to help with tasks&quot;.</p>
<p>Physical requirements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>ability to walk unaided</li>
<li>ability to lift 10 pounds (some tasks require more strength, but there's plenty of &quot;light-weight&quot; tasks as well!)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Time:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>on Sunday and Saturday: anywhere from 15 minutes to 6 hours</li>
<li>during the week: 5-10 minutes (e.g., moving a stack of 10 chairs between MPR and 3rd floor library, setting up a keyboard for an outside mini-concert, etc.)</li>
</ul>
